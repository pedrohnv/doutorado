AB  - This paper presents the computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided engineering (CAE) modeling of Cluj-Sud 110 kV high voltage substation in order to examine the influence of substation constructive elements and apparatus (e.g. phase conductors, bypass bus bars, breakers and towers) on the spatial electric field distribution. The substation belongs to FDEE Electrica distributie Transilvania Nord SA. In a first step the detailed three dimensional (3D) CAD models of the substation components are constructed and assembled in the CAD environment SolidWorks. Then the exact 3D coordinates of the terminals are automatically retrieved and the electric field distribution is computed on the 3D CAD model using a CAE software developed. The electric field distribution is represented on horizontal and transversal slices at the 3D CAD model in order to highlight the high intensity field zones and compare them with respect to the actual legislation norms of human exposure.

AB  - The recent advances in computer aided design (CAD) modeling of electromagnetic field distribution in high voltage (HV) substation are presented in this paper. The substation constitutive components (e.g. towers, breakers, circuit conductors, bus bars, transformers, etc.) were built-up by the authors as three dimensional (3D) CAD models and stored in a data base under the SolidWorks CAD environment. A computer aided design software (CAE) developed by the authors retrieves the 3D coordinates of the substation constitutive components and based on the specific loads computes the electromagnetic field spatial distribution. Both 3D CAD and CAE approaches are outlined on a 3D CAD model of a cell belonging to a 400kV substation. The simulated electromagnetic field distributions are computed and represented over the HV substation 3D CAD model. This allows to visualize and spot the high concentration electromagnetic field areas. A comparison between the measurements performed in situ and simulated electric field is made. The resulted electromagnetic field is finally compared with the professional human exposure limits in controlled environment.

AB  - The paper emphasize the results of the first systematic electromagnetic field measurements performed in high and very high voltage substations belonging to the Romanian national power grid in order to face the requirements of the EU directives regarding the human exposure to the electromagnetic fields. In the first part of the paper, the experimental field measurement results from a recently rehabilitated 400/220 kV substation belonging to the Romanian Transport and System Operator (TSO) Company are presented. It follows the experimental field measurement results from two 110/20/10 kV electricity distribution substations. The high intensity field zones are highlighted and the highest field value found is compared with the exposure limits given by the actual legislation. In the second part of the paper theoretical field computation methods are approached following two main reasons: to validate the experimental results and to proof their efficiency in evaluating the electromagnetic field values in the neighbourhood of the power devices from complex systems such as the substations. The final conclusions of the study performed and the actions proposed to be taken in practice finish the paper.

AB  - This paper outlines the most recent developments regarding the electric field distribution analysis inside very high voltage substations. The study was performed in order to develop and validate a powerful computation tool able to determine and predict the substation zones where the occupational exposure limits exceeds the admissible values imposed by the legislation. The study cases proposed in the paper are taken from the Romanian national power grid but the conclusions and the mitigation ideas outlined can be directly extended to substations belonging to other national power grids. In the first part of the paper the principles and methods proposed by the authors for the electric field computation in the vicinity of the power devices composing a high voltage substation are outlined. The validation of the computation module implemented was done by comparisons with detailed experimental measurements results performed inside a new rehabilitated 400 kV substation. The evaluation of the results outlines a good agreement between the computed and measured electric field values inside the analyzed substation. This fact motivates the usage of the computation module developed in the design of the future high voltage substations in the light of fulfilling the actual regulations regarding the human exposure to power electric and magnetic fields. In the second part of the paper scenarios to reduce the field values inside the future designed or rehabilitated substations are proposed and examined. The field distributions together with comparison between the field values before and after the implementation of the field mitigation techniques proposed are presented and discussed. The final conclusions ends the paper.

AB  - An attempt is made to reduce the maximum value of rms electric field (E-field) via the transposition of conductors in a 765-kV substation with reference to the occupational exposure. The method is applied to a extra-high-voltage substation, which is under construction. The effect of transposing the bay conductors (alone) and the bus conductors (alone) on the E-field distribution (at 2 m above the ground) over the area of the substation is discussed. Also, the topology of substation conductors that results in the minimum value for the maximum of rms E-fields is obtained via simultaneous transpositions of the bus and bay conductors. The area of the substation where the rms E-field exceeds the reference value of 10 kV/m (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection occupational exposure limit) is also reported for the existing topology. For this topology, the computed maximum value of the rms E-field over the area of the substation is 13.06 kV/m. This E-field is reduced to 7.999 kV/m with the best configuration of substation conductors obtained via transposition. The charge-simulation-method-based generalized algorithm for obtaining the best topology (among all permutations) of substation conductors, which results in the minimum value for the maximum of rms E-field magnitudes over the substation area is also reported.

AB  - Human exposure to environmental electric fields can be studied using anatomically realistic models of the human body. However, previous studies have focused on the exposure to idealized uniform electric fields and lack experimental verification. In this study, we developed a realistic simulation model of an electrical substation, featuring a very non-uniform electric field distribution. We then performed measurements of the external electric fields and induced currents in several exposure scenarios at the actual substation, allowing direct comparison between the measured and calculated external electric fields and currents induced in the body. The results indicated a very good agreement between simulated and measured values, demonstrating that large-scale non-uniform exposure scenarios can be accurately modeled. Furthermore, even though the highest external electric field strengths exceeded the reference levels defined in the international exposure guidelines by a factor of approximately two, the internal electric fields were compliant with the exposure limits with a margin of safety of three.

AB  - The electromagnetic field interferences (EMI) can influence both human health and functioning of electrical appliances. An EMI map is an important instrument for monitoring the health exposure limits versus the standards. In order to draw an EMI map measurement methodologies and advanced computational models are required. In case of high voltage (HV) and or medium voltage (MV) substations the numerical simulation has several advantages because it does not require investment in measurement devices and operative personnel and can easily analyze complex working scenarios covering both substation yard and its neighborhoods. Examples of numerical simulations are presented on the 3D model of the 110/20 kV substation named Biharia in order to visualize the electromagnetic field and to make comparisons with the professional human exposure limits.

AB  - With the increase in electricity demand, new sources of power generation and transmission lines are needed. Thus, because of the need to meet the demand for electricity, transmission lines and substations are increasingly present in urban and local areas near the movement of people. Since electromagnetic fields are a result of the electrical installation, there are rules governing the field exposure levels due to the possibility of causing adverse health effects. The institution which sets the levels of exposure limits is ANEEL (Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica), with the Normative Resolution n° 398. The analysis of electromagnetic fields can be performed by measurements, analytical calculations, or through computer numerical solutions. This study aims to determine the electromagnetic fields from computer numerical solutions of an output line of a gas-insulated substation, determining the minimum distances for operation and pedestrian traffic.

AB  - Exposure assessment is the determination or estimate of the magnitude, frequency of occurrence, and rate of exposure of an individual or a group to an environmental agent. The agents of interest in this case are the electric and magnetic fields (EMF) in the extreme low frequency range that includes the power frequency of 50/60 Hz. There are an increasing concern that exposure to EMF may be associated with biological and health effects. This concern has prompted numerous measurement projects and the development of instrumentation, methodologies, and exposure models and simulations. This paper identifies the status of EMF exposure assessment research related to occupational exposures. It draws the results to emphasize the unique aspects of EMF exposures in the home and utilities environments, and highlights the research needs. The intensities of electromagnetic fields have been measured under power transmission and distribution lines, at substations and industrial plants and near various electric devices including domestic electrical equipment. The field intensities have been related to the exposure time (duration of staying) in the different areas and have been compared with the international established standards. The data presented are useful for understanding the levels of electromagnetic fields that can be encountered in various places and also for estimating possible occupational and residential exposure levels.

AB  - This paper outlines the most recent developments regarding the magnetic field distribution analysis inside very high voltage substations. The study was performed in order to develop and validate a powerful computation tool able to determine and predict the magnetic field value inside any point of the substation and to check whether the exposure limits exceeds the admissible values imposed by the legislation. The study case proposed in the paper is taken from the Romanian national power grid but the conclusions outlined can be directly extended to substations belonging to other national power grids. In the first part of the paper the principles and methods proposed by the authors for the magnetic field computation in the vicinity of the power devices composing a high voltage substation are outlined. The validation of the computation module implemented was done by comparisons with detailed experimental measurements results performed inside a new rehabilitated 400 kV substation. The evaluation of the results outlines a good agreement between the computed and measured magnetic field values inside the analyzed substation. This fact motivates the usage of the computation module developed in the design of the future high voltage substations in the light of fulfilling the actual regulations regarding the human exposure to power electric and magnetic fields. In the second part of the paper results of the field values inside the studied substation are presented. The final conclusions end the paper.

AB  - With the increase in the transmission voltage levels, the effect of non-ionizing radiation (NIR) becomes a major concern. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation (ICNIRP) provides the guidelines for protection against NIR. It suggests the reference electric field (e-field) value of 10 kV/m for occupational exposure and 5 kV/m for general public exposure for the substation. In view of this, e-field prevailing in a 765 kV generating substation is studied in the present work to assess the spatiotemporal distribution using charge simulation method (CSM) based model. This should give a feel of the possible threat posed by these fields to the working personal due to NIR. The upcoming EHV substation in central India is considered with its bays, transmission lines, buses, and ground wires. The instantaneous values of e-field are computed at different instances over the 50 Hz voltage cycle, at 2 m height above the ground plane over the entire substation arena. The demo of spatiotemporal variation of e-field computed at different instants of time over a cycle using simulating charges taken from the real-number-field will be presented and discussed during the presentation. This would result in a time-space changing e-field-force, and give a feel of creation of churning of air and electric wind. This will have much higher significance at the heights were conductors are placed where the e-fields are higher. It is also shown that because of spatiotemporal variation of e-field, the rms value of e-field can be easily obtained using simulating charges taken from complex-number-field which is of significance from the point of view of ICNIRP guidelines.

AB  - A strong magnetic field exists within high voltage substations. People living close to these substations have expressed concern about the external electromagnetic field (EMF) generated from these substations. Salt River Project (SRP) utilizes EMF WorkStation, a simulation software package developed by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to evaluate the EMF level for existing and future substations. The objective of this study is to measure and map the EMF field inside a selected SRP urban substation, compare field measurement with simulation results, and then provide an independent and impartial evaluation of the EMF WorkStation software. The comparison results show that EMF WorkStation is able to provide acceptable estimation of the EMF generated by the substation.

AB  - The high level electric field intensity produced by high voltage inside 500 kV power distribution substations is harmful for the human (staff) health. It is very important to have knowledge about levels distribution of electric field intensity within power distribution substation. The paper presents results of investigation 50Hz electric field intensity distribution inside 500 kV power transmission substations in Russian Federation. The measurements of electric field intensity were done inside of twenty six power distribution substations. On base of the measurements, the map of the electric field intensity distribution was build for each substation. These maps are used for planning service works or for inspection of equipment on power substations. In the paper, there are estimations, in percents, what value of substation territory is occupied by different levels of electric field intensities.

AB  - The new European Union directive states that if the electric and magnetic field action values of 10 kV/m or 500 muT at the working place are exceeded, the employer has to ensure that the limit value, given as an induced current density in the body, is not exceeded. The aim of this study was to measure field strengths and find out how the new directive will affect working at Finnish 50 Hz, 400 kV substations. Spots where the action value was exceeded could be found at 75 % of the selected eight substations. The largest electric field strength, 14.3 kV/m, was measured between two adjacent busbars carrying the voltages having the same phase angle. Over 500 muT magnetic flux density was measured in one substation at the safety fence around a three-phase air-core reactor set. Fields were measured at a height 1 m above the ground. According to simple ellipsoid calculations the exposure limit, 10 mA/m of induced current density in the head or trunk, will not be exceeded. However, many of the maintenance tasks have to be done closer to the conductors and busbars and thus more in-depth study and measurements will be necessary at least in Finland.

AB  - High voltage substations produce strong electromagnetic fields (EMF) in the surrounding areas. People who live close to substations express concern about the possible health risk from the exposure to the EMFs. In this research, EMF characteristics are measured inside two 69 kV substations, and an independent and unbiased assessment of the EMF distribution in the substations is provided. The substation EMFs resulting from the field measurements are presented using 3-D plots and contour maps. The maps of EMF distributions and substation layouts are also overlapped to demonstrate their relationship. A conclusion is drawn by comparing the field measurements with the recommended limit of human exposure to the EMF.

AB  - With the rapid development of electric undertaking and the expansion of town scale, ultra-high voltage (such as ac 1000 kv, dc 800 kv) power transmission lines are coming to our lives. And with the development of ultra-high voltage power transmission line, the ultra-high voltage transformer substation will appear in the place with dense population and the electromagnetic pollution of this transmission and transformer equipment and its infection to the natives arouse the great concern from the society. In the other hand, the natives are afraid of the electromagnetic pollution and oppose the power construction, which brings about many unnecessary troubles. To study the situation of electromagnetic pollution due to the transmission and transformer equipment needs many measurements in the field. This paper focuses on electromagnetic radiation of ultra-high voltage power transmission line. Firstly, investigate the condition of being recognized of electromagnetic radiation and analyze the pollution status of environment and human body due to electromagnetic radiation. And then, study the electric and magnetic field under the transmission line by the method of equivalent charges and put forward the prevention policy to the electromagnetic radiation in the engineering of ultra-high voltage power transmission and transforming.

AB  - Excessive exposure to high levels of electromagnetic fields can induce adverse health effects. Numerical calculation is often used in the exposure assessments. However, in the traditional methods, the relative variables are all assumed to have fixed values without considering the effect of staff activity. To improve the deficiencies caused by this assumption, a new method for the exposure assessments based on the reliability theory was proposed in this investigation. As an example, the electric-field exposure in the booster station of a power plant with several paths was studied by the new method. The exposure reliability index and the failure probability of each path were first determined. Then, based on the determined reliability indices, the influence of the bus framework on the exposure was discussed by the sensitivity study, and a series system was set up to evaluate the electromagnetic exposure of the entire booster station. The proposed approach could be employed to assess the electric field in the substations by taking into account the staff activity, in order to improve the management of the occupational exposure in the power transmission and distribution projects.

AB  - As the voltage level of the substation increases and the large amount of electronic equipment is put into use, serious electromagnetic interference has been generated. Especially when the disconnector in AIS is suitable for small capacitive current operations, it does not have the arc extinguishing ability, which leads to the occurrence of medium between the contacts. Break down several times and form a transient overvoltage. This paper builds a 110kV overvoltage electromagnetic disturbance source system simulation model based on logic judgment in the ATP-EMTP software, and compares and analyzes the overvoltage simulation signals under different capacitive loads. The finite integration method, which is suitable for solving the theory of electric large-scale space electromagnetic field electric dipole antenna, is combined with CST MWS software to analyze and calculate the radiation interference of overvoltage, and the magnetic field intensity at a position 1m from the disturbance source in the simulation model is 90-480A/m, the test shows that the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 1m from the disturbance source in the test substation is 100-455A/m, which verifies the correctness of the simulation model and has guiding significance for the installation and construction of substation equipment.

AB  - This paper presents computations of the electric and magnetic fields of complex busbars, transformers and transmission line structures at transmission power station 110/10(20) kV. The fundamental sources of low frequency electromagnetic fields in the TS are the primary elements of the 110 kV open substations as well as connected 110 kV overhead lines. Due to the complexity of the geometry of the substation elements, it was necessary to apply a three-dimensional approach to the computation and analysis of the electromagnetic field. Computations of electromagnetic fields were conducted for quasi-static states of electrical values at a power frequency of 50 Hz. The calculated electric and magnetic fields were compared with permissible levels according to Croatian regulations. The maximum permissible levels for the electric field and magnetic flux density were found to be exceeded at some locations in the station.

AB  - Various regulations, aimed at the protection of human beings and electrical equipment against possible adverse effects resulting from exposure to electromagnetic fields, have been issued in many countries. Most of them are based on safety guidelines published by international expert groups. In this paper, electric and magnetic fields are calculated in the vicinity of 25 kV traction line supplying railway traction system. Calculation results are compared to exposure limits specified by safety guidelines and regulations. Possible countermeasures for reduction of electromagnetic fields are proposed. Because of the continuous growth of energy consumption and the tendency to site power lines and pipelines along the same route, the close proximity of power lines and buried metallic pipelines has become more and more frequent. Therefore, there has been and still is a growing concern about possible hazards resulting from the influence of power lines on metallic pipelines. Buried gas pipelines are exposed to corrosion due to induced voltages from an electric traction overhead line. This paper presents a method for calculation of the induced voltages to an underground gas pipeline from a neighbouring 25 kV electric traction overhead line in case of short circuit. Calculations are performed with EMTP-ATP software. Possible countermeasures for reduction of induced voltages are proposed.

AB  - Power frequency magnetic fields caused by medium voltage switchgear might disturb sensitive equipment such as video display units or might even conflict with exposure limits concerning people living or working near such installations. In order to prevent possible influences or adverse effects the knowledge of the magnetic field levels produced by the switchgear is necessary. A suitable concept to get magnetic field distributions around substations is described. This concept considers the emissions of switchgear from a general point of view and avoids investigating actual substations in detail. Rather it allows derivation of the field strength levels from the data of the switchgear type.

AB  - In the area beyond each high voltage overhead line or around any high voltage power equipment, integrated inside power stations or operating alone, high values of the electric field intensity (and/or magnetic field induction) accidentally occur. Certain preventive safety measures, both for the environment, as well as for the human personnel, are mandatory. An objective and fair assessment of the electric field intensity around all these facilities is mandatory, before considering any new design features or limiting the operational exposure. This paper shows some measurements of the electric field intensity, performed at the Fantanele 220kV/110kV/20kV Power Station, located in Central Transylvania, Romania. This power station is belonging to the National Romanian Power Grid Operator, TRANSELECTRICA S.A. Our case study is also filled with some electric field measurements, added to describe the electromagnetic field parameters. Data collected will be also used for the refurbishment of some existing power facilities in Romania and for a dedicated digital map of this potentially high-risk power objectives.

AB  - In the area of all power stations, or in their close proximity, there are, in some situations, high values of the magnetic field induction and/or electric field intensity. In many cases, low frequency electromagnetic fields are not taken in consideration, until recently, as dangerous for humans. A realistic and objective assessment of the electromagnetic field (magnetic field induction and electric field intensity) in the proximity of these facilities is a major step before designing new safety measures, suitable both for environment, as well as for human operators. This article presents a database, populated with measurements of these two main parameters measured inside or close to some major power stations, located in the Central Transylvania Region of Romania, belonging to the National Power Grid Operator, TRANSELECTRICA S.A. The newly created database will be the start point to build a digital map of field exposure for all the considered stations, before reducing or eliminating human exposure on certain dangerous zones. The given database could be also used for the refurbishment or construction of new safety features.

AB  - The paper deals with human exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric fields generated by transformer substation. The problem is twofold, i.e. it requires the calculation of power substation electric field and current density induced inside the human body. ELF electric field generated from a power substation is assessed by solving the Scalar Potential Integral Equation (SPIE) using the Source Element Method (SEM), a variant of the Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM). Knowing the electric field due to the substation the current density induced within the human being exposed to such field is obtained by solving the Laplace equation variant of the continuity equation using the direct Boundary Element Method with domain decomposition (BEM-DM). Some illustrative computational results for external electric field and internal current density are presented.

AB  - Grounding grids play a very important role for the safe operation of the substation. When grounding grids fault occurred, resulted in abnormal surface potential or uneven distribution, and that will be a serious threat to personnel and equipment. Considering the influences of leakage current and displacement current in the soil, establish mathematical model of transient electric field. Combining with the grounding grids of 800kV GIS substation, I established three dimensional electric field model of grounding grids using finite element method and obtained surface potential distribution of three-dimensional figure. And then I analyze the buried depth, soil resistivity, and other factors of grounding grids on the surface potential distribution, using the method of transient wave injection. At last, I calculated the surface potential distribution of the grounding grids in the case of fault and non-fault, proposed a method of grounding grids fault detection based on surface potential distribution features. Research shows that: the influence rule of the buried depth of grounding grids to the surface potential distribution of conductor and grids center are different. The surface potential increased gradually with the increase of soil resistivity. It is possible to detect grounding grids fault according to the characteristics of the surface potential distribution.

Detailed field measurements around this substation as well as numerical results in a 1000-kV area are provided. Most values observed are below the reference level indicated in the relevant national design guideline. Therefore, we can conclude that the power frequency electric fields around this UHV substation are safer for working personnel.

AB  - When lightning strikes bulk transmission lines or electric substations, large currents flow through towers or in substations and equipment structures before dissipating in the ground through the grounding systems. The electromagnetic fields generated by such lightning surges cause large currents and voltages, which may result in damage to equipment and serious accidents, such as failure of electrical transmission, and furthermore may be dangerous to personnel working nearby. Moreover, the immunity level of electronic equipment that contains semiconductors and LSI devices is low, and such equipment is sensitive to various types of electromagnetic stimuli. Therefore, it is important to analyze the transient behavior of grounding systems of power systems in order to study lightning protection and improve human safety. However, the transient behavior of grounding systems has so far been difficult to evaluate. In this paper, we propose a novel method in which the transient behavior is analyzed based on the finite-difference time-domain method, and confirm its validity through comparison between experimental results of the transient behavior and analytical results.

AB  - A pocket device to warn switchyard personnel of imminent insulation breakdown in a nearby HV plant has been developed. The detector is based on the well-known UHF technique for PD detection. However, it is much smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a conventional PD detector. It can discriminate against communication, broadcasting, and external PD sources present in substation switchyards and thus avoid false alarms. During the design stage, an analysis of the electromagnetic emission spectra of several substations was carried out. Continuous recording of frequency and amplitude enabled the identification of several discharge sources, whose characteristics were very dependent on climatic conditions. During laboratory and field testing, several RF sensors and pulse processing algorithms were tested using an oil tester to simulate PD in oil. Final tests in outdoor substations were carried out to verify the immunity of the detector to external back ground emissions while retaining an acceptable detection range for targeted internal discharges. The developed UHF pocket alarm has much greater sensitivity than AM radio, the current detection method. It provides simple light and sound warnings and thereby eliminates the need for continuous interpretation of interference sounds on a detuned radio.

AB  - Layout of the metal framework, which is widely placed in the power engineering, has effects on the electric field distribution. And moderate electromagnetic environment contributes to the health of staff in the high-voltage substation. Hence, in order to improve the exposure situation in the outdoor substation, the present study optimized the layout of the framework by using a probabilistic method. The exposure failure probability of each working path was calculated under various arrangement schemes, based on the practical environmental field and the level of field staff can bear safely. The occupational exposure situation was improved by finding out framework arrangement with the smallest failure probability, which corresponds to the safest exposure. The obtained results indicate that compact but uneven longitudinal gap between columns, the rhythmically placed beams, and medium sized root span of the column help to create optimal electric field exposure in the substation.

AB  - This paper outlines the most recent developments regarding the electric field distribution analysis inside very high voltage substations. The study was performed in order to develop and validate a powerful computation tool able to determine and predict the substation zones where the occupational exposure limits exceeds the admissible values imposed by the legislation. The study cases proposed in the paper are taken from the Romanian national power grid but the conclusions and the mitigation ideas outlined can be directly extended to substations belonging to other national power grids. In the first part of the paper the principles and methods proposed by the authors for the electric field computation in the vicinity of the power devices composing a high voltage substation are outlined. The validation of the computation module implemented was done by comparisons with detailed experimental measurements results performed inside a new rehabilitated 400 kV substation. The evaluation of the results outlines a good agreement between the computed and measured electric field values inside the analyzed substation. This fact motivates the usage of the computation module developed in the design of the future high voltage substations in the light of fulfilling the actual regulations regarding the human exposure to power electric and magnetic fields. In the second part of the paper scenarios to reduce the field values inside the future designed or rehabilitated substations are proposed and examined. The field distributions together with comparison between the field values before and after the implementation of the field mitigation techniques proposed are presented and discussed. The final conclusions end the paper.

AB  - This paper focuses on assessing the electric field exposure in the whole substation by the fault tree analysis. The component-level exposure situation along the path is studied by the reliability analysis, where the field distribution and the moving people are integrated. The system-level exposure situation is then analyzed by generating the exposure fault tree based on the component-level data. The exposure failure probability of the whole substation is ultimately evaluated by analyzing the fault tree's series-parallel system. The influences of the layers and the bounded parameters on the size of the fault tree are also studied in this paper. The results of the case study show that, with the help of the fault tree analysis, the complex exposure situation in a large substation can be clearly evaluated by a probability value.

AB  - Power stations have a very complex electromagnetic environment. The situation is typically worse in an HVDC converter station, because the electromagnetic field (EMF) levels are more severe in proximity to HVDC equipment. Therefore, it is very important to address electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues and compliance in the design and operation of HVDC converter stations. This article analyses and discusses in detail HVDC convertor station EMC concerns by focusing on three aspects of the overall design process: analysis method, computer model simulation and EMF calculation. The main purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of the HVDC station electromagnetic environment on personnel safety and specific equipment by examining the electromagnetic field of the entire converter station under various operating conditions. The analysis methods and procedures introduced in this article can provide guidance and reference for similar EMC analysis and design of offshore and onshore AC/DC converter stations.

AB  - The power frequency magnetic fields have a potential adverse health effects on people and MV switchgear acts as one of the prominent sources of magnetic field in the substation. The magnetic field distribution around 10 kV switchgear and the shielding efficiency of the enclosure are studied in this paper. Based on the basic theory of electromagnetic field, the mathematical model of the power frequency magnetic field of switchgear is established. The magnetic induction intensity is solved by finite element method (FEM), and the mesh controlling method is discussed. The shielding efficiency of enclosure is calculated, and the influence of enclosure’s magnetic permeability and thickness on shielding efficiency is analyzed. Then the shielding improvement suggestions are put forward according to the calculation results. The results show that, when the distance from the switchgear door is less than about 0.6 m, the magnetic induction intensity may reach the public exposure limit 100 μT. With the increase of the relative magnetic permeability and the thickness of enclosure, the shielding efficiency is improved, but gradually stabilized.

This paper investigates how FEM can be employed on biomedical engineering. A complete high fidelity human body model including frequency dependent materials and complex geometries was used. Three examples are described including a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, a human body on a substation environment and specific absorption rate (SAR) simulations on a human head due to a cell phone radiation. Advanced multiphysics technology coupling electromagnetic and thermal simulations are also addressed. A very good agreement between FEM simulations and measurement data was achieved for SAR calculations.

AB  - At present, the development of rail transit in China is very rapid, and the subway greatly facilitates people's transportation. Since the metro adopts THE DC power supply system, the dc magnetic bias fault of the transformer in the surrounding AC power network will be caused by the metro, which will affect the operation of the AC power network. The current research literature considers that the stray current of subway leads to the potential difference between the grounding grids of two substations at different positions, thus causing the dc magnetic bias fault of the transformer. This paper studies the feasibility of generating DC magnetic bias current through electromagnetic coupling between space electromagnetic field and nearby transmission lines while traction power supply catenary provides energy for subway. Firstly, the electromagnetic coupling model between subway overhead contact network and nearby transmission lines is established, the coupling relationship between them is deduced, and the influence law of different factors such as subway depth and grid area on grid induced voltage is analyzed. Then, a field measurement was carried out in a subway section of Chengdu city, a simulated grid loop was built, and the induced voltage signal of the simulated line was collected when the subway vehicles passed. It is found that subway traction power supply system has strong coupling effect on AC power network. It is also found that the induced voltage of the traction network on the grid is not only related to the relative position of the subway and the grid, but also related to the running state of the train. When the subway vehicle runs in the coupling interval, the moving magnetic field generated by the vehicle movement has a greater influence on the DC magnetic bias than the magnetic field generated by the catenary current.

AB  - When lightning strikes an electric substation, large currents generated by the stroke flow in the above ground structures and grounding system and dissipate in the soil. The electromagnetic fields generated by such high currents may cause damage to equipment and may be dangerous to personnel working nearby. In this paper, the frequency and time domain performance of a substation subjected to a lightning strike is described and discussed. The computed scalar potentials, electric fields, and magnetic fields are presented graphically as a function of spatial coordinates. As a function of time and as a function of both. Two cases are considered. The first case examines the substation grounding system only, while the second case includes an above-ground structure as well. It is believed that the results of the second case have not been published before. A double exponential lightning surge current is injected at one corner of the substation. The response of the grounding system to the frequency domain electromagnetic spectrum of this signal is computed by a frequency domain electromagnetic field analysis software package. The temporal and spatial distributions of the electromagnetic fields inside and near the substation are obtained by an inverse Fourier transformation of all these responses. The presence of a soil with an arbitrary resistivity and permittivity is accurately taken into account. The analysis sheds some new light on the understanding of the effects which take place at the higher frequencies.<>

AB  - This paper describes the magnetic field measurements performed in a public access area - a market place, situated in the close vicinity of a transformer substation part of the Romanian national power grid. The measurement results were compared to the limits, regarding the human exposure to electromagnetic fields, imposed by normative documents. An analytical simplified estimation was performed too. It was found that in some areas of the market place the magnetic field exceeds the levels imposed by current limiting exposure normative and guidelines. In the same areas, persons working in the market place reported frequent electrostatic discharges.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the induced current densities due to power system fields in the working environment by using the spheroidal calculation model. The induced current densities in a human body located in these extremely low frequency fields can be determined by calculation. The basic restriction of the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) guidelines for 50 Hz fields is 10 mA/m/sup 2/ (to workers). The study includes 251 measurement points in 400 kV switching substation. The fields in the substation were measured and then internal currents were calculated. The internal field and current density induced in a human body by the electric and magnetic fields was calculated using the spheroidal model. Measured values in the substation were 1.9-9.9 kV/m for electric fields and 0.49-9.2 /spl mu/T for magnetic fields. The induced internal currents were 0.37-1.9 mA/m/sup 2/ by electric fields and 0.0016-0.030 mA/m/sup 2/ by magnetic fields. Summed values were 0.37-1.9 mA/m/sup 2/. The internal current densities are clearly below the ICNIRP guidelines, 10 mA/m/sup 2/.

AB  - The electromagnetic compatibility environment of electronic transformer in substation is a parameter that the operation and maintenance personnel are concerned about while it’s difficult to be obtained. The research on state evaluation technology of the electromagnetic compatibility of electronic transformer can effectively prevent the electromagnetic compatibility faults and reduce the fault rate of electronic transformer. This paper proposes a method for evaluating the electromagnetic compatibility state of electronic transformer. Firstly, an evaluation index system is established. This index system covers two key sources of transient electromagnetic disturbance that affect electromagnetic compatibility state of electronic transformer, namely power port and signal port. The electromagnetic disturbance includes surge, electrical fast transient burst and damped oscillatory wave. Secondly, the weight of each factor is determined by the analytic hierarchy process method, and the membership function of each index is determined by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. This method makes up for the gap in the field of state evaluation of electromagnetic compatibility of electronic transformer, and gives early warning of electromagnetic compatibility faults and the evaluation results can guide the decision of electronic transformer in terms of operation and maintenance.

AB  - The subject of power frequency magnetic fields has become very popular during recent years. This is mainly due to two facts: the increasing usage of display units which represent a very sensitive interference victim and the increasing public concern with respect to adverse health effects caused by such fields. Switchgear installations act as one of the prominent sources of power frequency magnetic fields and therefore knowledge of their magnetic field amplitudes is required in order to assess potential effects. On the other hand switchgear installations are often very individual ones with consequently very individual magnetic field distributions. This basically requires an individual investigation of each installation - a procedure which has been shown as a very involved and cost consuming one in practice. The paper describes a basic assessment method which can be used to evaluate magnetic field distributions around switchgear installations from a general point of view. The resulting field distributions can be utilized to derive and to determine appropriate distances between switchgear and areas under consideration needed to comply with any limits concerning people or equipment.

AB  - It was observed that partial discharges were not detected from GIS insulators with the crack defects operated at 1100 kV in the UHV substation in China. The question is that whether crack defects can induce partial discharge at the operated voltage. In order to obtain the relationships between PD occurrence and crack configuration on GIS insulator operated at 1100 kV, the electric field strengths in the crack, changed with crack length, crack depth, crack direction, crack position, were simulated on a 1100 kV GIS insulator at operation voltage. The simulated results indicated that the field strength in the cracks, which located on the surface of the insulator or paralleled to the electric field direction, were close to that in the insulator around the crack, and the crack cannot induce partial discharge. However, the field strength in the cracks, which located in the deep position of insulator and in perpendicular to the electric field direction, was much higher than that in the insulator around the crack. For example, in the case of the crack located close to high voltage conductor, field strength in deep crack perpendicular to electric field direction could be 5.6 times of the field strength in the insulator around the crack, and it close to the field criteria of gas discharge, leading partial discharge occurred at operation voltage. The simulated results were verified by the experiment conducted on the insulators with cracks. The experimental results indicated that the crack could produce partial discharge, only when it is located in deep insulator material and in perpendicular to the electric field direction, and close to high voltage conductor.

AB  - Lightning transients processes appear when lightning strikes hit tall objects, such as transmission and communication towers or transformer substations. Large currents generated by the stroke flow in the grounding system and dissipate in the soil. The electromagnetic fields (EMF) generated by such high currents may cause damage to equipment and may be dangerous to personnel. The field theory method is used to examine the transient behaviour of the lightning processes in the grounding system.

AB  - The magnetic fields from electric power system have been studied for several years now at Tampere University of Technology (TUT). Several studies have been carried out where exposure to electric and magnetic fields have been measured. Exposure recommendations in force are given by the Council of the European Union and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The recommended current density value is 2 mA/m/sup 2/ for public exposure. For occupational exposure the recommended value is 10 mA/m/sup 2/ given by ICNIRP. The aim of this study was to calculate internal current induced by electric and magnetic fields of electric power system and to compare those results with the recommendations in force. The spheroidal calculation model was used. The internal currents calculated in this study were generally quite small.

AB  - This paper presents an estimation study for live transmission line workers exposed to power frequency electric and magnetic fields using a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). A real double circuit transmission line is selected. The live-line worker is exposed to fields in the right of way of the transmission at 3.28 feet (1 m) above the ground. Both fields' associated values have been generated using EPRI's EMF workstation software. The calculations are based on the charge simulation method for the electric field, and Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field. The generalization capability of the designed GRNN network under large number of worker positions within the right of way has been tested and predicted. Fast performance, accurate evaluation, and very good prediction have been obtained for the testing that covers the whole area.

AB  - The most known sources of the low-frequency electromagnetic field (EMF) can be found in electric power systems. Those systems and their power distribution parts have become the backbone of economic, technological and overall development of human society, intensely in modern-days. The actual humanity highly depends on the reliable power supply and thus a number of power distribution substations have been established, even in densely populated residential parts of the cities. The presence of such a power substation increases the public concerns on dangerous health effects, considering the exposure to EMF in the vicinity of substations. Thus, the comprehensive and detailed monitoring was demanded, along with the exposure assessment to EMF radiation. The continuous broadband monitoring method of the Serbian Electromagnetic Field Monitoring Network - SEMONT has been considered in this paper, in a case study of the power substation “NS7 - South Telep”, located in the city of Novi Sad, the Republic of Serbia. The exposure assessment, based on daily boundaries, has been employed, showing that acquired results emerge to be far below the Serbian prescribed reference levels.

AB  - The subject of power frequency magnetic fields has become very popular during recent years. This has mainly been due to two facts: the increasing usage of display units which represent a very sensitive interference victim and the increasing public concern with respect to adverse health effects caused by such fields. Switchgear installations act as one of the prominent sources of power frequency magnetic fields and therefore knowledge of their magnetic field amplitudes is required in order to assess potential effects. On the other side switchgear installations are often very individual ones with the consequent very individual magnetic field distributions. This means basically an individual investigation of each installation - a procedure which has been shown as very involved and cost consuming one in practice. The paper describes a basic assessment method which can be used to evaluate magnetic field distributions around switchgear installations from a general point of view. The resulting field distributions can be used to derive and to determine appropriate distances between switchgear and areas under consideration and hence to comply with any limits concerning people or equipment.

AB  - In the vicinity of each high voltage overhead line or high voltage power equipment, placed or not inside power stations, high values of the electric field intensity (and/or magnetic field induction) could appear sometimes, too. A lot of preventive safety activities, both for the environment, as well as for the human operators, are necessary. A true and fair assessment of the electric field intensity in the proximity of these facilities is mandatory, before adopting some new design features or limiting the human exposure. This paper will present a few measurements of the electric field intensity, performed by our team at the Fantanele 220 kV/110 kV/20 kV Power Station, located in Central Transylvania, Romania, belonging to the National Romanian Power Grid Operator, TRANSELECTRICA S.A. Our case study will also be completed with some electric field measurements, for a better perspective on the electromagnetic field parameters. Data will also be used for the refurbishment of the existing power facilities across Romania and for a future digital mapping of this high-risk power objectives.

AB  - It is well known that electromagnetic fields (EMF) are presented or produced on Utilities elements especially distribution feeders (DFs), which due to the demand, these have increased their capacity. However, DFs are operating near of their limits, which have produced an increase in EMF values, being a preoccupation for their possible effects on the human health. In this context, it is necessary to determine EMF values, which are exposed the population in order to guarantee the functioning of Utilities. In this research by using the Quickfield software based on Finite Elements (FE), EMF values on distribution feeders corresponding to three real electrical substations are determined. Furthermore, these simulated values are compared with measured values and reference threshold values suggested by international norms. Results show that the simulation procedure is effective to determine EMF on distribution feeders.

AB  - This paper describes the process of developing a method to report electric distribution field inspection data that is collected in various headquarters located in the NSP-Wisconsin service territory. The electric distribution inspection data include, field observations on equipment conditions, amp and voltage measurements taken from capacitors, recloser, and voltage regulators and other information taken by field personnel when inspecting distribution facilities. The electric distribution area covers approximately 20000 square miles in Western Wisconsin with a combination of urban and rural customers. The field inspection data is collected and entered in field or office computers. The data is stored in a central server and is available to all employees. Reports are created after the inspection data is collected The reports have information that can be used to improve the reliability and performance of the electric distribution. The benefits of this method of reporting information are that the data is available for all users, work that needs to be done is shown on the reports, and the information can be quickly reviewed using the computer instead of sorting through paper records. This paper shows how reports can be created using a database program and how the reports can be used to improve the electric distribution system.

AB  - The paper evaluates the currents induced in the human body when exposed to extremely low frequency (60 Hz) electric fields by numerical modelling with boundary elements. The exposure is driven by the voltage of a rectangular panel representing the control keyboard of a power substation room. The main focus is to study the variations of the current density along the vertical axis of the body when located at different distances from the panel. In addition, the sensitivity of the results for the current density when considering the human body with and without its internal organs is estimated. The numerical approach is based on the three dimensional boundary element method (BEM) with the kernel of Laplace equation, in which the human body model considered is a simplified representation which allows parametric modifications of its geometry and physical properties.

AB  - On account of the substation is a basis and important element of the power system, its maintenance plays a pivotal role in the stable operation of power grid. As the maintainer of the substation, the on-site staffs work long-term in strong electromagnetic field environment. Therefore, it is necessary to wear the working clothes strictly. In order to strengthen the working clothes wearing circumstance supervision, its better to carry out the real-time supervision on the on-site staffs. In this paper, a video-based working clothes wearing circumstance detection method was put forward. Firstly, we extract characteristics by HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradient) method and the color spatial distribution compactness presented in this paper. Secondly, the SVM(Support Vector Machine) classifier is trained to realize the substation maintainer detection. Finally, we model the electricity working clothes in the HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) color space and combine the performance characteristics to get the final results. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has a high accuracy in the substation surveillance video.

AB  - It's very good know the interest of those that design and construct the overhead lines to attenuate the magnetic field around these, especially to earth level, because it is possible to have impact to human body. On this line one of methods there are use for reduce the magnetic field is compacting the overhead lines, such as sizing two circuits with different function on the same pole [1]. Optimizing the arrangement of phase conductors for both circuits, it is possible to achieve a sensible mitigation of magnetic field near the overhead lines. In this paper the overhead line contain two 110 kV circuits, first that feed a distribution substation and second that feed a railway substation. It is considered an application who use the overhead lines who feed the Ghiroda - Timisoara railway substation presented in [2] with a single circuit 110 kV overhead line for distribution, and it calculate the magnetic field value considering succeeding all the possible configurations that can be realized commutating the two conductors of railway circuit. It is finding that exist some situations when mitigation of the field is very relevant. These situations can be considered to the design and construct of the overhead lines for mitigation the impact of electromagnetic field produce by overhead line.

AB  - State Grid Corporation of China(SGCC) proposed to build the unified strong smart grid with Chinese characteristics, that is the maintenance of electrical equipments has been gradually breaking human-controlled mode, transforming into smart mode and real-time monitoring of various equipments in substation. Besides, the condition intelligence judgment is one of center links. And the zinc oxide arrester is one kind of important overvoltage protector. Because of the superior nonlinear and protective value, it has been widely used in power system. However, the zinc oxide arrester doesn't have the discharge gap, the valve will gradually deteriorate in the effect of long-term running voltage or the arrester will be affected with damp for itself bad structure. These will cause the arrester's leakage current to increase, or cause the electric operational accident for the thermal runaway in critical condition. The traditional method is manual periodic patrol, inspection and transcript. It's not convenient to use and manage which makes operators to do much more and inefficient. What's more, it can't grasp the safe state of the arrester promptly and accurately. This article studies one kind of system to real-time acquire, transmit, preserve, manage and share the information such as the zinc oxide arrester's leakage current, the lightning frequency and timing. And form an information management system of the zinc oxide arrester's leakage current. All the related personnel can inquire the state of all the zinc oxide arrester, of course, it increases the work efficiency. Compared with other methods, this system has the simple structure and dependable performance, and can be used in the substation of strong interference of electromagnetic field.

AB  - Large power systems are normally operated with their neutral points directly earthed. At a major generating or switching station, this results in the provision of a large earth grid buried in the ground. The design of earthing systems requires a worst case approach. There is a possibility of heavy currents flowing into the earth grid from the overhead earth wires through the tower during a line conductor fault and from lightning strikes. The flow of earth current during a fault or lightning conditions results in a rise of earth grid potential with respect to a physically remote earth point, which can lead to unsafe conditions under some conditions for personnel and connected electrical plant. This paper aims to investigate the potential of adding novel coatings to the conventional copper earth grid conductors to enhance overall conductivity and diminish corrosion. This contributes to lowering the rise of earth grid potential. Graphene-coated copper performance as an earth grid conductor is evaluated with staged low voltage fault and the corrosion behavior in both a destructive and nondestructive environment. A comparison of the simulation software packages CDEGS and CST is also carried out using lightning strike conditions.

AB  - the conventional 66kV grounding insulating rod hanging and dismantling the grounding wire can not meet the maintenance of 66kV power cut transmission lines and equipment in a variety of tower types and operation positions. In order to meet the maintenance of transmission lines and equipment in various environments of 66kV power failure, a new 66kV rotatable grounding insulating rod will be developed in this paper, which will be improved and innovated in the two directions of chain and PTZ structure. Through the comparative and comparative experimental methods, the experimental results show that the PTZ structure is adopted as a new 66kV rotatable grounding insulating rod from the perspectives of efficiency, safety and economy. The improvement scheme shortens the time of hanging and removing the grounding wire for 66kV power outage maintenance, greatly reduces the operation difficulty, improves the operation efficiency, and further improves the safety of personnel, power network and equipment.

AB  - The correct operation of surge arresters under lightning and switching transient conditions requires that grounding be effective at high frequencies as well as at power system frequency. Effective high frequency grounding also limits the electrocution risk to substation personnel due to transient ground potential rise. This article assesses the performance of high frequency electrodes at typical lightning impulse current magnitudes. The enhancement of such electrodes by addition of bonded horizontal arms in cross and star arrangement is also investigated. The effective impulse resistances for electrodes having lengths up to 4.8 m are calculated over a range of impulse current magnitudes at the same location. The results obtained indicate that, for low impulse current magnitudes, the preionization electrode's resistance (R1) falls with increasing rod length, a behavior reflected in the measured dc resistance. The presence of horizontal enhancement was found to reduce R1 in all cases. The occurrence of soil ionization in the immediate vicinity of the electrode resulted in a reduced postionization resistance (R2) at higher currents, tending toward a common asymptotic value independent of both the length of the rod and the presence of electrode enhancements. The observed behavior is supported by numerical simulation of electric field and current density distributions, indicating that the high current performance of a grounding rod is heavily influenced by soil ionization and breakdown in high-field regions at the electrode extremities.

AB  - Power transformers are essential in the transmission of alternating current and are the most costly equipment in the substation. Although their failure rate is relatively low (less than two percent), the in-service failure of a power transformer can be very catastrophic. The restoration cost of in-service power transformer failures increases by up to seventy-five percent and loss of revenue by sixty percent. It is therefore prudent for utility companies to optimize the life of power transformers and mitigate in-service failures. “Early Detection Saves Lives”, a slogan associated with the fight against cancer is also very relevant to the life cycle management of power transformers. The health of the power transformer is reflected through its insulation strength. There are several on-line and offline tests used to assess the health of power transformer. These give rise to an enormous amount of data to be analyzed. Many utilities manually analyze these results and only focus on the most recent test results. This method of analysis is time consuming and is subject to human error. It abets the back-log of testing and not correcting developing faults in a timely manner. There are benefits that can be gained from using a computer program to store, analyze and trend power transformer data, as well as predict and monitor developing power transformer faults. Software are available to test and monitor power transformer oil via online devices; while other maintenance software analyze single electrical field tests. There is the potential to gain greater benefits from having one computer program that incorporates oil and electrical field tests results, as well as the age, loading and inspection data of the power transformers to determine their health status or condition index. This paper outlines the proposed architecture and features of a custom built Power Transformer Maintenance Software (PTMS). PTMS facilitates a paradigm shift from reactive maintenance (such as practiced at the Jamaica Public Service Company Limited) to a predictive maintenance approach. This study proposes the use of a customized integrated data management system to improve the life cycle management of power transformers.

AB  - There are many kinds of external phenomena with power equipments running state changing, and one of the important characters is acoustic signal mutation when power transformer would get out of order. But it is difficult to judge the acoustic change degree and describe the failure character scientifically only by human subjective sensation. The acoustic monitoring can be realized with non-contact measurement, the committed step is the acoustic signal processing, and intelligence fault diagnosis scheme is presented in this thesis. After acoustic signal collected in substation, the layer threshold de-noising algorithm is utilized, the signal characteristics based on wavelet package is extracted to be the gist of knowledge acquisition and consequence, and the fault diagnosis expert system is designed by acoustic quantative analysis. Through acoustic signal analyzing experiments, the effects of the de-noising algorithm and signal characteristics extraction method have been verified. The acoustic wave diagnosis expert system can solve many problems because of the high voltage and powerful electromagnetic field of the power system, and it would be a good reference to many power equipment fault identify.

AB  - The experience of the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois with metal-clad switchgear has been outstanding, both from the standpoint of reliability of operation and safety to personnel, two of the principal objectives sought by the engineers of the company when they pioneered this type of equipment. This equipment has been applicable not only to the voltage classes up to and including 15,000 volts, but also in the 33,000-volt class, of which the company has seven major installations which have been in service from 13 to 16 years. This report of experience with 33-kv metal-clad switchgear is offered as proof that development and use should be resumed and continued in what is undoubtedly a fertile field for the application of principles which are now generally accepted. It is not a detailed discussion of the design and construction of metal-clad equipment, but rather a factual record of progress already made and proved by 13 years of operating experience. Conclusions drawn from this report are that the main objectives sought after in the development of metal-clad type of switchgear have been obtained satisfactorily. Experience has demonstrated clearly its outstanding operating reliability as compared with the conventional open type, and its perfect safety record for operating and maintenance personnel has been made possible by the inherent safety features which are practical only in metal-clad equipment. If these and other factors which cannot be evaluated precisely are taken into consideration and if the further exploitation in the post-war period of materials and methods developed during the war is kept in mind, it would appear that there is no question about the continued development of metal-clad type of switchgear in all voltage classes. Repetitive manufacturing, standardization, and prefabrication are some of the most potent means of combating the continually rising cost of electrical station and substation installations. The electrical equipment manufacturers are applying these principles to a growing extent and are promoting their use throughout the industry. The principles, of course, are not new, the present movement being directed mainly toward a more intensive and wide-spread application. Neither the manufacturer nor the utilities can afford to neglect any application of these principles that can be justified economically.
