AB  - This work focuses on the measurement and analysis of the electric field for live working in a 1000-kV substation. Also, it compares the electric field and the shielding efficiency requirement of a 1000-kV substation with 1000-kV transmission lines. The electric field at the ground potential of the substation was measured using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based device. However, for safety reasons and to acquire rigorous data, finite element method (FEM) was applied to calculate the electric field at equipotential. Two cases of entry into equipotential were considered: one in which the worker moves along tension insulators to live conductors, and another where the worker is lifted to an energized bus bar on an insulated elevating platform. Our results indicate that the electric field values on the worker in the 1000-kV substation and transmission lines are about the same at ground potential, while at equipotential, the substation's maximum electric field is 25.2% higher outside the conductive clothing and 47.4% higher outside the metallic mask as compared to the 1000-kV transmission lines. Based on these results, for live working in a 1000-kV substation, we recommend the use of conductive clothing with 60-dB shielding efficiency, which is similar to that used in live working on a 1000-kV transmission line, but the metallic mask should have 25-dB shielding efficiency, which is 5 dB higher than that used for the transmission line. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB  - This paper presents the computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided engineering (CAE) modeling of Cluj-Sud 110 kV high voltage substation in order to examine the influence of substation constructive elements and apparatus (e.g. phase conductors, bypass bus bars, breakers and towers) on the spatial electric field distribution. The substation belongs to FDEE Electrica distributie Transilvania Nord SA. In a first step the detailed three dimensional (3D) CAD models of the substation components are constructed and assembled in the CAD environment SolidWorks. Then the exact 3D coordinates of the terminals are automatically retrieved and the electric field distribution is computed on the 3D CAD model using a CAE software developed. The electric field distribution is represented on horizontal and transversal slices at the 3D CAD model in order to highlight the high intensity field zones and compare them with respect to the actual legislation norms of human exposure.

AB  - Energized scale models of EHV/UHV substations can be used as design tools to detennine the electric field distribution. To prove the method, an energized scale model of an existing 345-kV substation has been designed and built. The paper reviews modeling and instrumentation problems and their solutions, calibration and verification tests, and discusses the accuracy of model measurements. Comparison of corresponding test points shows that the agreement between substation and model measurements is good: the mean of absolute values of errors is about 4.6%. In the course of the study, the electric field strength of the model was mapped, and the effects of a wide range of modifications were examined. The feasibility of short circuit (charging) current measurements on model vehicles was also proven.

AB  - With the development of cities and electric power industry, the demand of electrical energy, generation, transmission, distribution and the voltage levels have increased considerably. Therefore the power frequency electric field and environmental impact assessment near / under the high voltage overhead busbars, incoming and outgoing feeders inside the high voltage substations (HVS) have caused wide public concern. Nowadays most research on electric field are concerned with calculation the electric field distribution around the transmission lines, insulators and cables but they rarely concerned with its calculation inside HVS. In this paper, a different type of calculation is achieved, the charge simulation method (CSM) is employed to analyze the three dimensional (3-D) electric field distribution near / under the busbars, incoming and outgoing feeders. At last, the effects of changing the level of operating voltage, the space between the phases, the level of calculation inside HVS is demonstrated.

AB  - the possible effect of low frequency electric field exposure in occupational and residential environments raises the question of how electric fields are created, and what effects they may have. Utilities in particular are interested in the sources and levels of electric fields associated with their transmission lines, feeders, substations and related equipments. Moreover the value of electric field distribution produced by or around the electrical equipments is one of the essential factors in the design and development of high voltage electrical equipments (transmission lines, bus bars & insulators....etc). Therefore monitoring these equipments for electric fields is achieved in this paper. In this paper not only the simulation of electric field using charge simulation method (CSM) in three dimensional (3-D) is achieved by using electric field modeling program developed by the authors but also the electric field is measured into actual conventional 500/220 kV Cairo 500 substation under 500 kV busbar and the simulated results is compared with the actual measured values. The simulation results are matched with the measured values with a very small tolerance about 4.4%.

AB  - An adaptive fast multipole higher order boundary element method combining fast multipole (FM) with a higher order boundary element method is studied to solve the power frequency electric field (PFEF) of substations. In this new technique, the iterative equation solver GMRES is used in the FM, where matrix-vector multiplications are calculated using fast multipole expansions. The coefficients in the preconditioner for GMRES are stored and are used repeatedly in the direct evaluations of the near-field contributions. Then a 500kV outdoor substation is modeled and the PFEF of the substation is analyzed by the novel algorithm and other conventional methods. The results show that, in computational cost and the storages capability aspects, the algorithm proposed in this study has obvious advantages. It is suitable for the calculation of the large-scale PFEF in complex substations and the design of electromagnetic compatibility.

AB  - The recent advances in computer aided design (CAD) modeling of electromagnetic field distribution in high voltage (HV) substation are presented in this paper. The substation constitutive components (e.g. towers, breakers, circuit conductors, bus bars, transformers, etc.) were built-up by the authors as three dimensional (3D) CAD models and stored in a data base under the SolidWorks CAD environment. A computer aided design software (CAE) developed by the authors retrieves the 3D coordinates of the substation constitutive components and based on the specific loads computes the electromagnetic field spatial distribution. Both 3D CAD and CAE approaches are outlined on a 3D CAD model of a cell belonging to a 400kV substation. The simulated electromagnetic field distributions are computed and represented over the HV substation 3D CAD model. This allows to visualize and spot the high concentration electromagnetic field areas. A comparison between the measurements performed in situ and simulated electric field is made. The resulted electromagnetic field is finally compared with the professional human exposure limits in controlled environment. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper deals with the calculation of the electric field strength in high voltage (HV) substations comprising complex geometrical structures. Generalized charge simulationmethod is proposed for improving the precision of the calculation of the electric field strength. The objective of this analysis is to examine the influence of towers, HV apparatus and fences on the spatial electric field distribution. For this purpose, a three-dimensional generalized model of HV substation has been developed, including phase conductors, bypass busbars, HV apparatus, fences and towers (denoted as Full model). The obtained results of the calculation of the electric field strength are compared with the Simplified model, which only includes phase conductors connected to HV network. Verification of the proposed Full model performed by comparing the calculated and in-field measured values of the electric field strength within HV substations and in their vicinity gives very promising results. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - For evaluating power frequency electromagnetic field in working corridor of a high voltage substation, a calculation model of power frequency electric field in working corridor of high voltage substation is proposed by combining boundary element method (BEM) and charge simulation method (CSM) and by considering the interference from switching equipment. According to the structural characteristics of equipment in substation, indirect boundary integral equation of the interface of the suspension electrode and the dielectric is deduced, and the corresponding algebraic equations and calculation formulas of matrix elements are presented. Calculation method of the power frequency electric field in substation is implemented. Furthermore, a typical 500 kV substation is taken as an example to calculate the power frequency electric fields of single equipment and single-phase equipment in the substation, and simulation is performed with the software IES-Coulomb to verify the correctness of the calculation. The proposed model and calculation method can be applied to design of UHV substation for estimating the power frequency electric field and improving the electric field distribution in working corridor.

AB  - This paper outlines the most recent developments regarding the electric field distribution analysis inside very high voltage substations. The study was performed in order to develop and validate a powerful computation tool able to determine and predict the substation zones where the occupational exposure limits exceeds the admissible values imposed by the legislation. The study cases proposed in the paper are taken from the Romanian national power grid but the conclusions and the mitigation ideas outlined can be directly extended to substations belonging to other national power grids. In the first part of the paper the principles and methods proposed by the authors for the electric field computation in the vicinity of the power devices composing a high voltage substation are outlined. The validation of the computation module implemented was done by comparisons with detailed experimental measurements results performed inside a new rehabilitated 400 kV substation. The evaluation of the results outlines a good agreement between the computed and measured electric field values inside the analyzed substation. This fact motivates the usage of the computation module developed in the design of the future high voltage substations in the light of fulfilling the actual regulations regarding the human exposure to power electric and magnetic fields. In the second part of the paper scenarios to reduce the field values inside the future designed or rehabilitated substations are proposed and examined. The field distributions together with comparison between the field values before and after the implementation of the field mitigation techniques proposed are presented and discussed. The final conclusions end the paper.

AB  - This paper outlines the most recent developments regarding the electric field distribution analysis inside very high voltage substations. The study was performed in order to develop and validate a powerful computation tool able to determine and predict the substation zones where the occupational exposure limits exceeds the admissible values imposed by the legislation. The study cases proposed in the paper are taken from the Romanian national power grid but the conclusions and the mitigation ideas outlined can be directly extended to substations belonging to other national power grids. In the first part of the paper the principles and methods proposed by the authors for the electric field computation in the vicinity of the power devices composing a high voltage substation are outlined. The validation of the computation module implemented was done by comparisons with detailed experimental measurements results performed inside a new rehabilitated 400 kV substation. The evaluation of the results outlines a good agreement between the computed and measured electric field values inside the analyzed substation. This fact motivates the usage of the computation module developed in the design of the future high voltage substations in the light of fulfilling the actual regulations regarding the human exposure to power electric and magnetic fields. In the second part of the paper scenarios to reduce the field values inside the future designed or rehabilitated substations are proposed and examined. The field distributions together with comparison between the field values before and after the implementation of the field mitigation techniques proposed are presented and discussed. The final conclusions end the paper. © VDE VERLAG GMBH.

In the first part of the paper the principles and methods proposed by the authors for the electric field computation in the vicinit y of the power devices composing a very high voltage substation are outlined.

AB  - The paper emphasize the results of the first systematic electromagnetic field measurements performed in high and very high voltage substations belonging to the Romanian national power grid in order to face the requirements of the EU documents regarding the human exposure to the electromagnetic fields. In the first part of the paper, the experimental field measurement results from a recently rehabilitated 400/220 kV substation belonging to the Romanian Transport and System Operator (TSO) Company are presented. It follows the experimental field measurement results from two 110/20/10 kV electricity distribution substations. The high intensity field zones are highlighted and the highest field value found is compared with the exposure limits given by the actual legislation. In the second part of the paper theoretical field computation methods are approached following two main reasons: to validate the experimental results and to prove their efficiency in evaluating the electromagnetic field values in the neighbourhood of the power devices from complex systems such as the substations. The final conclusions of the study performed and the actions proposed to be taken in practice finish the paper.

AB  - The paper emphasize the results of the first systematic electromagnetic field measurements performed in high and very high voltage substations belonging to the Romanian national power grid in order to face the requirements of the EU Directives regarding the human exposure to the electromagnetic fields. In the first part of the paper, the experimental field measurement results from a recently rehabilitated 400/220 kV substation belonging to the Romanian Transport and System Operator (TSO) Company are presented. It follows the experimental field measurement results from two 110/20/10 kV electricity distribution substations. The high intensity field zones are highlighted and the highest field value found is compared with the exposure limits given by the actual legislation. In the second part of the paper theoretical field computation methods are approached following two main reasons: to validate the experimental results and to proof their efficiency in evaluating the electromagnetic field values in the neighbourhood of the power devices from complex systems such as the substations. The final conclusions of the study performed and the actions proposed to be taken in practice finish the paper. ©2008 IEEE.

AB  - The Romania's accession to the European Union in 2007 focused all efforts towards the harmonization with the European legislation and regulation. Transelectrica, the Romanian TSO Company, is the first company which, further to an intensive process of rehabilitating and modernizing its infrastructure, has met the technical requirements to ensure the interconnected operation of the Romanian power system grid with the power systems in Europe. By Transelectrica's admission in UCTE and ETSO-noteworthy organizations for the TSOs in the European Union-Romania became the first EU non-member country in the South-Eastern Europe, which was integrated in specialty structures of EU. In this light, the paper outlines the first study that has been performed in a Romanian very high voltage substation in order to face the requirements of the European Directives regarding the human exposure to the risks arising from electromagnetic fields. One has to outline that since 2006 the corresponding EU Directives have been transposed into the Romanian legislation by two official governmental documents. The case study was carried out for one of the most recently rehabilitated 400/220 kV Romanian substation located in Rosiori, the Satu-Mare County, that interconnects the Romanian power system grid with the EU power grid via the Ukrainian Mukacevo substation. The experimental measurement values obtained were afterwards compared with the public and professional electromagnetic field exposure limits. Colour maps of the electric and magnetic field distribution are presented in order to easily locate the high intensity field zones inside the substation. In order to validate the experimental results, analytical computation and numerical modelling of the electric and magnetic field values have been done as well. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical results outline a good agreement. The main conclusions of the study performed end the paper.

AB  - Power system substations and HV power lines are sources of electric and magnetic fields of industrial frequency. Guidelines for permissible electric and magnetic field strengths regarding human exposure and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are provided by standards. In this paper a novel method for calculating 3D electric field near power system facilities is presented. Computation procedure is based on integral equations and boundary element methods. The influence of polynomial order of functions used to approximate the unknown linear charge densities over the elements is tested for constant, linear and cubic spline functions. Due to a complex geometry of substations, a large system of equations needs to be solved to find the unknown charge densities over the elements of the model. In order to reduce computational efforts adaptive cross approximation (ACA) is employed. The results of computation are in a good agreement with measurements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To ensure the normal operation, calculation of electric field in ultra-high voltage substation is particularly important. A line model is proposed to simplify current model and improve computational efficiency. Combining this model with boundary element method, this article described a method to calculate the electric field at the vicinity of complex equipment of ultra-high voltage substation. An actual substation environment is also simulated, with detailed analysis of simulation results, proposed model and method are verified as valid and effective. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Calculation of electric field based on integral equations approach and suited to solving large-scale problems is presented. Integral equations are solved by appliance of BEM and Galerkin method. Unknown distribution of the surface charge density is approximated by bicubic splines, which ensure smooth approximation of sources. Accurate calculation of electric fields requires detailed modeling of power system equipment inside substations. This results in large models, which are solved by parallel computing. Numerical results are compared to measured fields inside a 400 kV substation. Comparison shows good agreement, thus approving applicability of the proposed approach in analysis of exposure to electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic compatibility. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The power frequency electric field in the HV substation has aroused more and more attention. In the paper, the power frequency electric field in 500kV substation is calculated using the boundary element method considering the influence of the switching equipment. According to the structural characteristics of the switching equipments, the indirect boundary integral equation of the suspension electrode was formulated. The modeling method and procedure for the power-frequency electric field calculation in the substation are presented. Finally, a typical 500kV substation is taken as an example for the calculation on the power-frequency electric filed, the IES coulomb is used, and results indicate that the power frequency electric field depends mainly on the height of the bus bar. To decrease the influence on the environment caused by the HV transmission lines and switching equipment, the height of the bus bar should be increased. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - It is essential to research the method of UHV AC stations electromagnetic environment modeling and prediction computation while it is difficult and inaccurate to calculate 3D electric field distribution around equipment in UHV AC substations by means of using some softwares. In order to improve the calculation efficiency, a new method based on BEM is proposed to deal with complex electrical equipment. In this method, a new computational model called line-modle is introduced to simulate wire. The space electric field near equipments can be obtained through calculating the surface charge and the equivalent change, as a result, the computational accuracy and speed enhance dramatically. The electric field profiles around reactors in Jindongnan substation are calculated and the availability of the method is demonstrated by comparing the simulated and the measured results.

AB  - The paper deals with human exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric fields generated by transformer substation. The problem is twofold, i.e. it requires the calculation of power substation electric field and current density induced inside the human body. ELF electric field generated from a power substation is assessed by solving the Scalar Potential Integral Equation (SPIE) using the Source Element Method (SEM), a variant of the Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM). Knowing the electric field due to the substation the current density induced within the human being exposed to such field is obtained by solving the Laplace equation variant of the continuity equation using the direct Boundary Element Method with domain decomposition (BEM-DM). Some illustrative computational results for external electric field and internal current density are presented.

AB  - There are many numerical models for computing extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields of high-voltage substations and power lines. More accurate computation results can be obtained using 3D algorithms. In this paper, a 3D quasistatic model for computation of the scalar electric potential and electric field intensity distribution of overhead power lines is presented. Phase conductors, shield wires and towers of overhead power lines are modelled using thin-wire cylindrical segments of active and passive conductors and using subparametric spatial 2D finite elements. Self and mutual coefficients of these components are numerically computed using an originally developed advanced double 2D numerical integration. Thereafter, they are included in the system of linear equations for computation of the charge density distribution. Special attention is given to examining the influence of the overhead power line towers on the electric field intensity distribution in their close vicinity. Therefore, a computer program for detailed segmentation of typical steel lattice towers of various types is developed. The accuracy of the presented model is verified by comparing the obtained results with other computed and measured published results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with human exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric fields generated by a transformer substation. The problem is twofold, i.e. it implies the assessment of the power substation electric field and the related current density induced inside the human body. The ELF electric field generated from a power substation is determined by solving the Scalar Potential Integral Equation (SPIE) using the Source Element Method (SEM), a variant of the Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM). Knowing the electric field in the vicinity of a substation the current density induced inside a simplified cylindrical model of the human body is obtained by solving the Pocklington integro-differential equation using the Galerkin-Bubnov Indirect Boundary Element Method (GB-IBEM).

AB  - The influence that from power frequency electromagnetic fields induced by ultra high voltage (UHV) substation to human body has always been concerned by researchers, but related research has rarely been reported. This paper chose to study UHV Changzhi substation, by using ANSYS harmonic analysis and submodeling technology, the power frequency electric field calculation for UHV substation containing human model was achieved. The electric field, potential, current density of human body and the effect of shoes were studied; the numerical and measurement results on the electric field distribution along several paths in substation, the numerical and theoretical results on the current distribution inside human body were compared, respectively; the correctness of method and the accuracy of results were validated. Based on the results, the induced current inside human body is mainly conduction current, the maximum induced current density is 9.15 mA/m2, which could meet professional standard. Conclusion of the thesis can be used to judge whether power frequency electric fields induced by UHV substation were safe for human body and be referenced by future UHV projects. © 2014 Chin.

AB  - Finite element method is a commonly used method in the numerical calculation of electric field. When the number of entities in the solving domain is large and the structure is complex, the regional discretization of the whole model is often difficult. Therefore, based on the basic geometric shape of the model, a fast method of modeling and mesh generation was proposed for the numerical analysis of the electric field of the complex model. Taking a simple two-dimensional model as an example, the paper introduced the algorithm for generation and mutual positional relationship judgment of external surround entities. Combined with the mesh generation strategy of finite element electric field calculation, the multi-layer mesh density was increased by parameterization on the surface of the model, and the efficiency and quality of the mesh generation were high. The method was applied to the calculation of electric field on the surface of ultra high voltage direct current (UHVDC) valve hall equipment. The calculation results show that the maximum error of this method is only 3. 80% compared with the sub-model method, and the computational efficiency is greatly improved compared with the sub-model method. This method realizes the fine mesh control of large-scale complex models, and has a guiding significance for fast and accurate modeling of large scale finite element electric field. © 2018 Chin.

AB  - The distribution of power frequency electric field caused by super-high level power transmission engineering is an important issue in evaluation of electromagnetic environment problem. The calculation of this field around power transmission facilities in complex environment using Charge Simulation Method (CSM) is sometimes out of action for the reason of not enough RAM. This paper put forward a domain decomposition CSM. This method divided the calculation region into several subdomains with some overlapped parts at the border first. Then CSM is applied to these subdomains respectively to get the distribution of simulation charges. The impact of the adjacent domain (boundary problem) is solved by using iterative method. Finally, the distribution of electric field in different domains can be calculated respectively with simulation charges obtained inside its own domain. This method is verified and it is applied to the analysis of power frequency electric field around 500kV transformers in 500kV substation. The results indicate that this method can speed up the calculation and decrease the requirement of RAM. This method provides an effective way to analyze the distribution of power frequency electric field with complex environment. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - As the substation is the place with the most concentrated primary and secondary equipment in the power system, the electromagnetic environment has been of more interest. Therefore the calculation and assessment on the power frequency electromagnetic field in high voltage substation become increasingly important. In this paper, the 3 D models of the substation element were built. The equipment such as conductor, insulator and grading ring which were regarded as research objects was simplified in geometry to reduce the difficulty of subdivision and the number of subdivision, and also to increase the computing speed. In the paper, finite element method was used to calculate electric field intensity at 1.5 m horizontal plane. And an example of a 500 kV substation interlayer was used to compare the electric field intensity of the simplified model with that of the original model. The results show that the relative error is between -7%-11% within 8 m from the edge of the model and -3%-5% beyond 8 m. The error is less than 5 V/m beyond 15 m from the edge of the model. The computation complexity of the simplified model is a quarter of the original model, so the effect of the simplification is satisfactory. ©, 2014, Power System Technology Press.

AB  - The power-frequency electric-field strength has to be evaluated in the design of substations. We established a three-dimensional model of UHV substations by the ANSYS software, and using harmonic analysis method, we simulated and calculated electroquasistatic (EQS) field. Moreover, taking a new design for high voltage (HV) shunt reactor circuit in Huainan-Shanghai UHV AC transmission demonstration project substation as an example, we analyzed the effects of tubular busbars, power apparatus and frameworks on electric-field distribution at 1.5 m above ground, and optimized the height of tubular busbars. The results show that the maximal electric-field strength at 1.5 m above ground of most areas is determined by the height of tubular busbars. The structures of power apparatus only influence the electric-field distribution in vicinity areas. Framework location affects the position where the maximal value appears. The original height of tubular busbars is 17.15 m with a maximal electric-field value of 9.34 kV/m. And the optimized height of tubular busbars is 16.65 m. An addition calculation of the electric field in Changzhi and Jingmen UHV substations is carried out respectively. The results show that the electric-field values meet the requirments of the design standard. And the difference between numerical results and measured values is less than 10% in the main areas of two substations.

AB  - This paper investigates the power frequency electric fields around a 1000-kV ultra-high voltage (UHV) substation which is located in Jingmen, China. Detailed field measurements around this substation as well as numerical results in a 1000-kV area are provided. Most values observed are below the reference level indicated in the relevant national design guideline. Therefore, we can conclude that the power frequency electric fields around this UHV substation are safer for working personnel. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - A numerical computation of low-frequency electromagnetic field near power apparatus and systems that may be used for analysis of occupational and general public low frequency electromagnetic field exposure is described in this paper. The compulation is based upon the integral equation approach and the usage of the method of moments for solving such equations. The charge that causes the irrotational component of electric field is calculated from known potentials of wires. The rotational component of electromagnetic field is calculated from a priori known line-currents taking into account the influence of the induced eddy currents in earth. The application of the computation is illustrated by the analysis of the occupational electromagnetic field exposure in a 400 kV substation at 50 Hz. © 2003 IEEE.

AB  - To reduce the level of power frequency electric field exposure that may bring health risks to the substation staff, the layout of electric equipment in substation is optimized to reduce the strength of near-ground electric-field of electric equipment. A three-dimensional geometric model of 220 kV outdoor distribution equipment was built and the actual power frequency electric field distribution was simulated by the simulation software. The equipment region with high electric field level was selected as the region to be optimized. Then fitness function and limitations of the particle swarm optimization mathematical model applied to electric problem was raised. To reduce the external electric field distribution as the optimization goal, the overall optimization was calculated. Moreover, based on the results, the device location was finely tuned in order to reduce the high field strength distribution inside the area. The optimized electric field distribution was compared to the original distribution, and it was found that the fitness function value of the overall optimization was reduced by 83.4%, and the fitness function of the regional optimization reduced by 29.1%. Results show that using PSO to adjust equipment layout can reduce the current level of substation power frequency electric field exposure without the increasing of the construction cost. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

AB  - In order to carry out research on the method of UHV stations electromagnetic environment modeling and prediction computation, this paper, based on the method of moment, simulated the steady-state electromagnetic disturbance of all voltage levels in UHV substations by using a software of CDEGS, emphatically analyses the power frequency electric-field and power frequency magnetic-field at the circuitry aisle and the relay cell zone as well as 20 m away from the wall of UHV substations. The simulation results illustrate that: the maximum power frequency electric field at the circuitry aisle of Jindongnan substation, Nanyangare substation and Jingmen substation appear in the tubular generatrix which connect TV and TA, as well as the space below HGIS. The maximum power frequency electric field of this three stations are both beyond the occupational exposure limit 10 kV/m; The results of other power frequency electric field are all lower than the corresponding standards; the maximum power frequency magnetic field at the circuitry aisle and the relay cell zone are all lower than the occupational exposure limit and electrical and electronic equipment immunity standard limit.

AB  - In this paper the authors propose a numerical model of the human body that can be correctly included, without any arbitrary restrictions, in complex electrical systems with three-dimensional geometry, in order to predict, by means of the charge simulation method, the electric field strength on the surface and induced currents. Shielding effects of buildings with reinforced concrete are considered. Numerical applications and comparisons among computed and measured results are reported. A very good agreement also with respect to results available in technical literature is outlined.

AB  - The electromagnetic field interferences (EMI) can influence both human health and functioning of electrical appliances. An EMI map is an important instrument for monitoring the health exposure limits versus the standards. In order to draw an EMI map measurement methodologies and advanced computational models are required. In case of high voltage (HV) and or medium voltage (MV) substations the numerical simulation has several advantages because it does not require investment in measurement devices and operative personnel and can easily analyze complex working scenarios covering both substation yard and its neighborhoods. Examples of numerical simulations are presented on the 3D model of the 110/20 kV substation named Biharia in order to visualize the electromagnetic field and to make comparisons with the professional human exposure limits. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents computations of the electric and magnetic fields of complex busbars, transformers and transmission line structures at transmission power station 110/10(20) kV. The fundamental sources of low frequency electromagnetic fields in the TS are the primary elements of the 110 kV open substations as well as connected 110 kV overhead lines. Due to the complexity of the geometry of the substation elements, it was necessary to apply a three-dimensional approach to the computation and analysis of the electromagnetic field. Computations of electromagnetic fields were conducted for quasi-static states of electrical values at a power frequency of 50 Hz. The calculated electric and magnetic fields were compared with permissible levels according to Croatian regulations. The maximum permissible levels for the electric field and magnetic flux density were found to be exceeded at some locations in the station.

AB  - This paper presents results of measurements and computations of the electric and magnetic fields of complex busbars, transformers and transmission line structures at transformer station 400/110 kV. The fundamental sources of low frequency electromagnetic fields in the transformer station are the primary elements of the 400 and 110 kV open substations and associated overhead lines. Due to the complexity of the geometry of the substation elements, it was necessary to apply a threedimensional approach to the computation of the electromagnetic field. Measurements were performed by EMS 100 field meter and computations of electromagnetic fields were conducted for quasi-static states of electrical values at a power frequency of 50 Hz. The calculated electric and magnetic fields were compared with measured values and permissible levels according to Croatian regulations. Measurements were performed for real working conditions for twelve different profiles in the transformer station. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - There is alternating electromagnetic field around 10 kV transformer when it is live. When the worker enters the electric field during live maintenance, the distribution of electric field will change unevenly. When the electric field of human body reaches a certain intensity, it will bring personal injury to the worker. In order to avoid this situation, the finite element method is used to establish the transformer and human body model for numerical calculation of the working area. The distribution of electromagnetic field around the transformer and the change of electromagnetic field after joining the human body model are obtained. The safe distance is obtained by measuring the distance, so as to determine whether the corresponding protection needs to be taken. Protection measures. This paper provides technical and theoretical basis for the safe operation of live working of 10 kV high voltage transformer. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents calculations of the electric and magnetic fields of complex busbars, transformers and transmission line structures at the transmission power station 400/110 kV Ernestinovo. By constructing and bringing the TS 400/110 kV Ernestinovo in operation, it was expected that electric and magnetic fields would arise within and outside the fence of the transformer station. The fundamental sources of low frequency electromagnetic fields in the TS Ernestinovo are the primary elements of the 400 and 110 kV open substations as well as the connected 400 kV and 110 kV overhead lines. Due to the complexity of the geometry of the substation elements, it was necessary to apply a three-dimensional approach to the calculation and analysis of the electromagnetic field. Calculations of electromagnetic fields were conducted for quasi-static states of electrical values at a power frequency of 50 Hz. The calculated electric and magnetic fields were compared with permissible levels according to Croatian regulations. The maximum permissible levels for the electric field and magnetic flux density were found to be exceeded at some locations in the station. © 2007 FEI STU.

AB  - With the increase in transmission voltage level, and the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), the effects of non-ionising radiation on biological elements at high-voltage substations have gained significant importance. The electric field (E-field) distribution in an upcoming 765 kV substation in the Indian subcontinent is computed using the charge simulation method (CSM). CSM is used to model the 765 kV bays, transmission lines, buses, and ground wires in the substation. The three-dimensional (3D) E-field is calculated through the superimposition of E-fields obtained in two orthogonal planes using infinite-line charges. This proposed method of using infinite-line charges gives realistic results. The simplistic model using infinite-line charges greatly reduces the complexity of the CSM-based model (due to the reduced number of charges) apart from increasing the CSM-based model accuracies. This fact has been demonstrated by comparing these results with those of CSM-3D-model of a detailed bay model (including major equipment and associated support structures). The complex-charge-based CSM helps in computing the root mean square value of the E-field at a point, directly, as per ICNIRP guidelines. This RMS value of the E-field is compared with the occupational exposure reference value prescribed in the ICNIRP guidelines. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.

AB  - Artificial intelligence technology has developed rapidly, and inspection robots have been increasingly applied to the inspection work of substations. The electromagnetic environment of the substation is complex, and whether the inspection robot can work normally in a complex electromagnetic environment is a problem worthy of attention. Therefore, this paper establishes an inspection robot model to explore the electric field distribution of the inspection robot during substation operation. The Charge Simulation Method is suitable for the calculation of open domain, and the Finite Element Method is suitable for the calculation of complex boundary problems. Combining the advantages of the two, this paper uses the mixed calculation of Finite Element Method and Charge Simulation method to analyze the electric field distribution around the inspection robot when it's working. The results of computation show that the electric field around each device is distorted, and the electric field distortion around the top device is the most serious. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Safety of electric power systems depends heavily on distribution of electric field in high-voltage switchgear. Switchgear failure can lead to fatal disasters in important systems. It is necessary to evaluate electric field and insulation performance for high-voltage switchgear in key systems. In this paper, considering a high-voltage switchgear system designed for nuclear power station, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed for the whole system. Distribution of electric field is simulated under different loads, including the specified voltage and the overload. The insulation property of the switchgear system is then evaluated. Experiment on the physical prototype validates the simulation evaluation. To make the electrical field well distributed and reduce peak value, method of orthogonal experiment is used for parameter design. Optimization and improvement are then proposed. The optimization results show that the reliability is improved and the electric field is well distributed. The numerical model is established on personal computer, while it is solved remotely on High Performance Computing Center. Corresponding modeling techniques and computing methods are provided in this paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the era of intellectualization, many substation inspection robots are being put into operation, but they will cause electric field distortion in the surrounding space during operation. This paper establishes a three-dimensional simplified simulation calculation model for 500kV substations and inspection robots. Based on the boundary element method, we simulate the power frequency electric field of the substation switchyard and analysis the distortion electric field when the inspection robot is in the station. The results show that when the electric field intensity is strong, the distortion coefficient caused by the robot will be larger, and the maximum can reach 2.25 times, and when the electric field intensity is small, the distortion coefficient will be smaller, and the distortion coefficient is 1.42 times on average. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - In the last decades, the interest of researchers and public regarding the effects of electromagnetic field on living beings and in particular on humans has increased more and more. Scientific studies have sought to establish exposure limits for the general public and workers exposed to intense fields due to occupational environments in which they operate. This paper addresses the problem of power frequency electric and magnetic fields occurring in a substation, in the area of access paths and, in particular, near equipment serviced frequently by the workers. The Low Frequency electric and magnetic fields values measured in a typical configured air insulated substation are in good agreement, when compared, with computed values. The best agreement has been obtained for the magnetic field. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Modern researches of electromagnetic fields (EMF) are based on the concept that complicated theoretical investigations are resulting in appropriate design solutions, and they are almost exclusively developed as applied researches. Generally, two directions are presented. The first one is based on the simplification of numerical calculation models, and the second one is based on models of objectified physical measurements in hard conditions. In both cases, however, the result is the same objective, which can be summarized as follows: create the optimal variant of solving the impact of the EMF, both in existing and new power facilities. The paper presents the analysis of numerical calculation of the EMF of distribution substation and detailed operational measurement program, which includes all measurements in stationary state with measurement location. The analysis of calculations and measurements results must indicates the possible dangerous places and gives the recommendations of measures for elimination of electromagnetic influences or their reduction to an acceptable level, according to the Regulations. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - The functional principle of power electronic systems as used for high voltage direct current transmission schemes or for static VAR compensators, leads to significant low frequency electric and magnetic fields in the station area as well as in its vicinity. Beside their impact on technical systems these field strength levels have to be assessed with respect to human exposure as well. The paper describes the field sources to be considered in the relevant frequency range and shows an approach to determine the field strength amplitudes by means of numerical simulations. The procedure is demonstrated for practical installations. Typical levels for both magnetic and electric fields are presented to be expected for areas inside and outside the stations. The numerical results are verified by means of practical measurements during the test operation of a power factor compensation station.

AB  - When lightning strikes an electric substation, large currents generated by the stroke flow in the above ground structures and grounding system and dissipate in the soil. The electromagnetic fields generated by such high currents may cause damage to equipment and may be dangerous to personnel working nearby. In this paper, the frequency and time domain performance of a substation subjected to a lightning strike is described and discussed. The computed scalar potentials, electric fields, and magnetic fields are presented graphically as a function of spatial coordinates, as a function of time and as a function of both. Two cases are considered. The first case examines the substation grounding system only, while the second case includes an above-ground structure as well. It is believed that the results of the second case have not been published before. A double exponential lightning surge current is injected at one corner of the substation. The response of the grounding system to the frequency domain electromagnetic spectrum of this signal is computed by a frequency domain electromagnetic field analysis software package. The temporal and spatial distributions of the electromagnetic fields inside and near the substation are obtained by an inverse Fourier transformation of all these responses. The presence of a soil with an arbitrary resistivity and permittivity is accurately taken into account. The analysis sheds some new light on the understanding of the effects which take place at the higher frequencies. © 1995 IEEE

AB  - When lightning strikes an electric substation, large currents generated by the stroke flow in the aboveground structures and grounding system and dissipate in the soil. The electromagnetic fields generated by such high currents may cause damage to equipment and may be dangerous to personnel working nearby. In this paper, the frequency and time domain performance of a substation subjected to a lightning strike is described and discussed. The computed scalar potentials, electric fields and magnetic fields are presented graphically as a function of spatial coordinates, as a function of time and as a function of both. Two cases are considered. The first case examines the substation grounding system only, while the second case includes an aboveground structure as well. It is believed that the results of the second case have not been published before. A double exponential lightning surge current is injected at one corner of the substation. The response of the grounding system to the frequency domain electromagnetic spectrum of this signal is computed by a frequency domain electromagnetic field analysis software package. The temporal and spatial distributions of the electromagnetic fields inside and near the substation are obtained by an inverse Fourier transformation of all these responses. The presence of a soil with an arbitrary resistivity and permittivity is accurately taken into account. The analysis sheds some new light on the understanding of the effects which take place at the higher frequencies.

AB  - With the increase in the transmission voltage levels, the effect of non-ionizing radiation (NIR) becomes a major concern. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation (ICNIRP) provides the guidelines for protection against NIR. It suggests the reference electric field (e-field) value of 10 kV/m for occupational exposure and 5 kV/m for general public exposure for the substation. In view of this, e-field prevailing in a 765 kV generating substation is studied in the present work to assess the spatiotemporal distribution using charge simulation method (CSM) based model. This should give a feel of the possible threat posed by these fields to the working personal due to NIR. The upcoming EHV substation in central India is considered with its bays, transmission lines, buses, and ground wires. The instantaneous values of e-field are computed at different instances over the 50 Hz voltage cycle, at 2 m height above the ground plane over the entire substation arena. The demo of spatiotemporal variation of e-field computed at different instants of time over a cycle using simulating charges taken from the real-number-field will be presented and discussed during the presentation. This would result in a time-space changing e-field-force, and give a feel of creation of churning of air and electric wind. This will have much higher significance at the heights were conductors are placed where the e-fields are higher. It is also shown that because of spatiotemporal variation of e-field, the rms value of e-field can be easily obtained using simulating charges taken from complex-number-field which is of significance from the point of view of ICNIRP guidelines. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The magnitude of the electric field (E-field) in a 765 kV substation is reduced by altering the conductor clearances in view of the occupational exposure limits. Multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) along with the charge simulation method (CSM) is utilized in arriving at the optimal clearances of the substation conductors. An EHV substation is modeled with the dimensions and the clearances as in the actual layout of a substation. The E-field results obtained using the finite-line based modeling and infinite-line based modeling of conductors, are compared in terms of the model accuracy and the computational time. The advantages of using the infinite-line based CSM model in view of the occupational exposure is detailed. With the proposed GA-CSM routine, the maximum value of the E-field in the substation is reduced to 10 kV/m (from the existing value of 13 kV/m). The proposed method is used with the existing topology and the best possible transposed topology to obtain the modified layouts. A novel EHV substation layout with different ground clearances for the inner bays and the outer bays is presented. The GA-CSM routine proposed in this work is applicable to any EHV substation with the multiple conductor arrangements. © 2022

AB  - Increasing voltage level in generation and transmission system have become inevitable. The threats of non-ionizing radiation and their biological effects at substations have increased. As per International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation and Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines suggest maximum limits for electric and magnetic field exposure is 10 kV/m and 1 mT for occupational and 5 kV/m and 250 μT for public exposure. Keeping this in view results of a case study of electric field distribution in an upcoming 765 kV substation in India are computed and discussed in this paper. Using the existing layout of this substation, the E-fields at 2 m height above the ground plane are computed using FEMM (a free ware). Results show that Bays which are at a height of 14 m from ground are dominant and contributing more to the E-fields. The paper further computes and compares E-field strength due to (i) a single conductor (a phase of bay alone), (ii) single bay (iii) and with all the bays of substation with buses, overhead headlines and ground wires. The effect of bay height (around 14 m) on the E-field is also reported. The average E-field in substation arena is well within the ICNIPR suggested limit of 10 kV/m, whereas E-field at some places exceeds this value. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - An attempt is made to reduce the maximum value of rms electric field (E-field) via the transposition of conductors in a 765-kV substation with reference to the occupational exposure. The method is applied to a extra-high-voltage substation, which is under construction. The effect of transposing the bay conductors (alone) and the bus conductors (alone) on the E-field distribution (at 2 m above the ground) over the area of the substation is discussed. Also, the topology of substation conductors that results in the minimum value for the maximum of rms E-fields is obtained via simultaneous transpositions of the bus and bay conductors. The area of the substation where the rms E-field exceeds the reference value of 10 kV/m (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection occupational exposure limit) is also reported for the existing topology. For this topology, the computed maximum value of the rms E-field over the area of the substation is 13.06 kV/m. This E-field is reduced to 7.999 kV/m with the best configuration of substation conductors obtained via transposition. The charge-simulation-method-based generalized algorithm for obtaining the best topology (among all permutations) of substation conductors, which results in the minimum value for the maximum of rms E-field magnitudes over the substation area is also reported. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Research purposes: The main substation is a very important facility to the urban rail transit, but it is very difficult to select its site. Hope to the public correct understanding the main power substation electromagnetic effects, to change the public impression on the main substation and make the site selection of the substation more smooth and efficient, this paper analyzes and researches the electromagnetic impact of the main substation on the surrounding environment. Research conclusions: From the interpretation of the term of the electromagnetic radiation, the analysis of the standard and test data on the electromagnetic impact of the substation at home and abroad and especially from the analysis of the test data for the existing main substation, it can be seen the main substation's electromagnetic impact on the surrounding environment comes from three aspects: One is from the power frequency electric field, the other one is from the power frequency magnetic field and the final one is from the radio interference. Among them, the radio interference can be negligible and, the impacts of the power frequency electric field and magnetic field effect are far below the standard limits at home and abroad and basically equal to the general atmospheric background values, without any impact on the surrounding residents.

AB  - The electromagnetic environment of the coal mine substation and the electromagnetic characteristics of typical equipments were measured. The near-field and far-field spectrums in the underground substation and pumping station were analyzed, and the measure methods were studied. The results show that typical devices like the transformers, magnetic starters, high voltage switches are the main effect factors of electromagnetic radiation in the transformer station, and also the major electromagnetic disturbance sources in underground transformer station. The pump house motors have little effects on the electromagnetic environment at normal working hours, underground personnel positioning system have some effects on the electromagnetic environment, transformer have a large influence on the near-field magnetic field, the near-field electric noise of the wire cable at entrance of the vacuum feed switches is larger.

AB  - This paper develops a mixed finite-element, analytical solutions, equivalent surface impedance methodology for the computation of electric and magnetic field distributions near power facilities. The proposed method enables efficient consideration of conductor sag, ground surface irregularities, proximity effects of metallic components such as transmission line towers, and transformer tank walls as well as human presence. Application examples of this methodology are given, illustrating that under a single-circuit 400 kV transmission line, the maximum electric field intensity at 1.5 m height from the ground is generated at a distance of 10 m from the line center while the maximum current density induced in a human standing on the ground is developed in the ankle; the computed values are practically half of the admissible limits of 5 kV/m and 2 mA/m2, respectively, foreseen for general public exposure by international standards. © 1965-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Power stations have a very complex electromagnetic environment. The situation is typically worse in an HVDC converter station, because the electromagnetic field (EMF) levels are more severe in proximity to HVDC equipment. Therefore, it is very important to address electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues and compliance in the design and operation of HVDC converter stations. This article analyses and discusses in detail HVDC convertor station EMC concerns by focusing on three aspects of the overall design process: analysis method, computer model simulation and EMF calculation. The main purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of the HVDC station electromagnetic environment on personnel safety and specific equipment by examining the electromagnetic field of the entire converter station under various operating conditions. The analysis methods and procedures introduced in this article can provide guidance and reference for similar EMC analysis and design of offshore and onshore AC/DC converter stations. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Live working is important for the continuity of electricity supply in power system. Experiment results of 50% switching impulse sparkover voltages (U 50) for different live working entering routes on a real tower are presented. The potential and electric-field distribution around the 750 kV straight tower window with a line worker inside, was analyzed via an approach combing charge simulation method and indirect boundary element method. The comparison demonstrates the close relationship between electric-field distribution and U50. The sparkover voltage and the maximum electric-field strength change synchronously for a specific structure. Generally speaking, the higher the electric filed strength is, the lower the sparkover voltage will be. Thus, the experiment procedure for deciding the best entering route can be simplified according to the electric-field distribution calculation. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of extra high voltage power grid, electromagnetic radiation arouses people's intensive concern. With an engineering example: physical discomfort of teachers and students in primary school near a 500 kV AC transmission lines, distribution of power frequency electric field and power frequency magnetic field under the lines is analyzed with program based on charge simulation method (CSM) and simulation current method (SCM) respectively. Moreover, measured data indicate that electric field intensity on the roof of the teaching building partially approaches national public exposure limit in good weather condition; it exceeds the limit in bad weather condition (high relative humidity). The solution proposal for unsafe electric field environment is to fix three shielding lines (LGJ-50/30) to reduce electric field strength from 3.43 kV/m to 1.35 kV/m. Even in rainy weather condition, electric field strength also meets the national standards' request.

AB  - This study presents the estimation of the electric and magnetic fields level inside a 400 MVA electrical substation. Located in the northeast region of Brazil, the power plant operates with 230 and 69 kV at 60 Hz frequency. The on-site measurements were performed at previously selected locations covering the whole courtyard and followed the international and national regulatory standards. The electrical and magnetic fields 2-D contour maps over the entire courtyard are presented, which allow better visualisation and analysis of the exposure levels around all equipment. By using the GoldenSurfer V.13 tool, eight interpolation methods were applied to predict unsampled locations. The plots were made using the method that best fit the sampled dataset after the cross-validation technique is used. The measurements were taken during six days during a period of 16 h on 741 locations. For this electrical substation, the maps validate the high electric field level close to breakers and switches at 230 kV and high magnetic field close to equipment operating at 69 kV. The comparison between the exposure levels and those established in current guidelines indicate that the electromagnetic environment on this substation is safe for the occupational population as well as for the general public. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This paper deals with the analysis of electric and magnetic fields in highvoltage substations connecting renewable energy sources. The development of large capacity parks based on renewable energy sources required new substations for interconnection with the National Power System. These new substations have small sizes and a reduced number of equipment in order to achieve a compact construction. In addition, a concern regarding the impact of electric and magnetic fields on environment and occupational health has appeared. The analysis of electric and magnetic fields must be done in the design stage. The programs developed based on MATLAB software provide a solution for the analysis of electric and magnetic fields within electrical substations and in the vicinity of power lines.

AB  - Excessive exposure to high levels of electromagnetic fields can induce adverse health effects. Numerical calculation is often used in the exposure assessments. However, in the traditional methods, the relative variables are all assumed to have fixed values without considering the effect of staff activity. To improve the deficiencies caused by this assumption, a new method for the exposure assessments based on the reliability theory was proposed in this investigation. As an example, the electric-field exposure in the booster station of a power plant with several paths was studied by the new method. The exposure reliability index and the failure probability of each path were first determined. Then, based on the determined reliability indices, the influence of the bus framework on the exposure was discussed by the sensitivity study, and a series system was set up to evaluate the electromagnetic exposure of the entire booster station. The proposed approach could be employed to assess the electric field in the substations by taking into account the staff activity, in order to improve the management of the occupational exposure in the power transmission and distribution projects. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Current assessment methods for the power frequency electromagnetic exposure ignore the temporal and spatial distribution effects of human beings, and fail to analyze the transmission line or the substation as a whole. To improve deficiencies in traditional approaches, we put forward a new approach to assess the electromagnetic environment using the concept of structure reliability analysis. The well-known 35 kV air-core reactor magnetic field calculation model was set up as an example, and the exposure performance function of the reliability analysis was established based on the magnetic field distribution. A design point method was used to calculate the exposure reliability index and the failure probability of three paths under assessment. Thereby, the series-parallel model was introduced to study the electromagnetic exposure of the whole substation. It was shown that the failure probability of each path was 3.71%, 1.26%, and 10.95%, respectively. The safest path for exposure was at two-phase side and 7 to 8 meters far from the origin of the reactors. Therefore, the exposure reliability analysis, which was developed from the traditional electromagnetic calculations and was combined with the probability distribution of human motion, could be treated as an effective way to assess the exposure in real transmission and transformation projects. ©, 2015, Gaodianya Jishu/High Voltage Engineering.

AB  - Layout of the metal framework, which is widely placed in the power engineering, has effects on the electric field distribution. And moderate electromagnetic environment contributes to the health of staff in the high-voltage substation. Hence, in order to improve the exposure situation in the outdoor substation, the present study optimized the layout of the framework by using a probabilistic method. The exposure failure probability of each working path was calculated under various arrangement schemes, based on the practical environmental field and the level of field staff can bear safely. The occupational exposure situation was improved by finding out framework arrangement with the smallest failure probability, which corresponds to the safest exposure. The obtained results indicate that compact but uneven longitudinal gap between columns, the rhythmically placed beams, and medium sized root span of the column help to create optimal electric field exposure in the substation. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This article investigates the impacts of electric potential (EP) and electromagnetic fields (EMF) on human health, especially for those living or working near a distribution system, as a consequence of faults inside the distribution system supplied by an outdoor substation. A case study was carried out using a 115/22 kV substation and a 22 kV distribution system of Thailand’s Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), with simulated faults injected at the top of a pole of distribution lines located at three different locations. Two methods were proposed for EP and EMF reduction: 1) bonding the ground grid of the substation and the ground rod of the riser pole, and 2) connecting the overhead ground wires of the substation and that of the distribution system. The study results confirm that the two proposed methods offer practically effective problem-solving solutions for reducing EP, and they are therefore able to mitigate the risk of equipment damage. The spatial distribution of EMF measured in the vicinity of the distribution system was found to comply with the threshold set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA), indicating that those living or working outside the substation were safe. © 2020, © 2020 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.

AB  - A strong magnetic field exists within high voltage substations. People living close to these substations have expressed concern about the external electromagnetic field (EMF) generated from these substations. Salt River Project (SRP) utilizes EMF WorkStation, a simulation software package developed by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to evaluate the EMF level for existing and future substations. The objective of this study is to measure and map the EMF field inside a selected SRP urban substation, compare field measurement with simulation results, and then provide an independent and impartial evaluation of the EMF WorkStation software. The comparison results show that EMF WorkStation is able to provide acceptable estimation of the EMF generated by the substation. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - This paper evaluates the currents induced in the human body when exposed to extremely low frequency (60 Hz) electric fields by numerical modelling with boundary elements. The exposure is driven by the voltage of a rectangular panel representing the control keyboard of a power substation room. The main focus is to study the variations of the current density in the human body when located at different distances from the panel. In addition, the sensitivity of the results for the current density when considering the human body with and without its internal organs is estimated. The numerical approach is based on the three dimensional boundary element method (BEM) with the kernel of Laplace equation, in which the human body model considered is a simplified representation which allows parametric modifications of its geometry and physical properties.

AB  - The paper evaluates the currents induced in the human body when exposed to extremely low frequency (60 Hz) electric fields by numerical modelling with Boundary Elements. The exposure is driven by the voltage of a rectangular panel representing the control keyboard of a power substation room. The main focus is to study the variations of the current density along the vertical axis of the body when located at different distances from the panel. In addition, the sensitivity of the results for the current density when considering the human body with and without its internal organs is estimated. The numerical approach is based on the three dimensional Boundary Element Method (BEM) with the kernel of Laplace equation, in which the human body model considered is a simplified representation which allows parametric modifications of its geometry and physical properties.

AB  - The article gives an estimate of the low-frequency electromagnetic field close to electrical installations. The main sources of the harmful effect of EMF on electrical personnel are considered. The practice of normalizing electromagnetic fields of low frequency (50 Hz) of the countries of the European Union (EU) and Russia is given. The concept of specific energy for electromagnetic non-ionizing low-frequency influence on tissues of the human body is formulated. The principle of normalization of electric and magnetic fields of 50 Hz with their additive influence on the electrotechnical personnel is proposed. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, it is evaluated the electric field at the ground level of a 220 kV overhead transmission line and the corresponding busbars in a substation, under the capacitor bank switching-off effect. The simulation was performed using the EMTDC/PSCAD software package, to obtain the transient overvoltages in the transmission line and in the busbars. These computer programs present an efficient graphical user interface integrated with a time domain integration tool, which can be used successfully to simulate power system transients, including network control devices. It provides fast, accurate and flexible solutions, by applying the integration trapezoidal rule to solve the mathematical models. The electrical field was calculated using the CIGRE equivalent charge model. Finally some conclusions that provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of the electric field distribution in a substation due to the capacitor bank switching-off effect will be pointed out.

AB  - This paper presents an edge-based smoothed finite element method (ES-FEM) for the assessment of human exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric fields. The problem domain is first discretized into a set of four-node tetrahedral elements, and linear shape functions are employed to interpolate the field variables. Then, the smoothing domains are further formed with respect to the edges of elements. In order to improve the accuracy of lower order interpolation, a gradient smoothing technique (GST) is introduced to perform the electric potential gradient smoothing operation over each smoothing domain. Based on the generalized smoothed Galerkin weakform, the discretized system equations are finally obtained. Numerical examples, including both benchmark and practical complex cases, demonstrate that the present method possesses the following interesting properties in assessing human exposure to ELF electric fields: (1) super accuracy and faster convergence rate; (2) higher computational efficiency; (3) insensitive to mesh distortion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lightning strikes thermal power plant will affect the normal operation of sensitive devices. However, due to the complex structure of thermal power plant, the calculation of electromagnetic field distribution is not accurate, and there is a lack of lightning protection specifications for low-voltage systems. Firstly, taking a thermal power plant in China as the object, an electromagnetic model of the low-voltage system including large irregular grounding grids, transformers, distribution lines, overhead cable trays, and external lightning protection systems is established, and a calculation method suitable for spatial electromagnetic fields of the complex model of thermal power plant is proposed. Secondly, the method is applied to the calculation of the maximum value of the magnetic fields at different layers, and the results show that the calculation accuracy is greatly improved. Finally, a method for optimizing the spatial layouts of sensitive devices in thermal power plant is proposed. This article provides data support for the design specifications and standards for lightning protection of low-voltage systems in thermal power plant. The spatial layouts of sensitive devices are optimized to achieve the purpose of rational use of building spatial and saving engineering costs. © 2021

AB  - A system consisting of an electric machine and a human body is studied and the resulting electric field is predicted. A 3-phase induction machine operating at full load is modeled considering its geometry, windings, and materials. A human model is also constructed approximating its geometry and the electric properties of tissues. Using the finite element technique the electric field distribution in the human body is determinedfor a distance of 1 and 5 m from the machine and its effects are studied. Particularly, electric field potential variations are determined at specific points inside the human body and for these points the electric field intensity is computed and compared to the limit values for exposure according to international standards. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - It is well known that electromagnetic fields (EMF) are presented or produced on Utilities elements especially distribution feeders (DFs), which due to the demand, these have increased their capacity. However, DFs are operating near of their limits, which have produced an increase in EMF values, being a preoccupation for their possible effects on the human health. In this context, it is necessary to determine EMF values, which are exposed the population in order to guarantee the functioning of Utilities. In this research by using the Quickfield software based on Finite Elements (FE), EMF values on distribution feeders corresponding to three real electrical substations are determined. Furthermore, these simulated values are compared with measured values and reference threshold values suggested by international norms. Results show that the simulation procedure is effective to determine EMF on distribution feeders. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - It is well known that human safety regarding electromagnetic contamination due to the presence of electrical devices in residential areas, like transmission or distribution lines, substations and transformers is imperative. These devices contribute to residential or industrial electromagnetic field exposure, which can be correlated with serious drawbacks for the health as childhood leukemia and; cancer. In this context, in order to guarantee people health, it is crucial that utilities and other stakeholders can attend in a suitable way to these worries, being important for such, levels of existing electromagnetic fields in their infrastructure analysis. The main goal of this study is to determine and analyze the EMF exposure levels of four real-life substations and their corresponding distribution feeders (twenty one). With these measurements and estimated ones obtained through the use of commercial packages, comparison with regulatory exposure levels are made. Results are discussed and analyzed. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the various physical mechanisms of interaction between a worker’s body and the electromagnetic field at various frequencies, the principles of numerical simulations have been discussed for three areas of worker exposure: to low frequency magnetic field, to low and intermediate frequency electric field and to radiofrequency electromagnetic field. This paper presents the identified difficulties in applying numerical simulations to evaluate physical estimators of direct and indirect effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields at various frequencies. Exposure of workers operating a plastic sealer have been taken as an example scenario of electromagnetic field exposure at the workplace for discussion of those difficulties in applying numerical simulations. The following difficulties in reliable numerical simulations of workers’ exposure to the electromagnetic field have been considered: workers’ body models (posture, dimensions, shape and grounding conditions), working environment models (objects most influencing electromagnetic field distribution) and an analysis of parameters for which exposure limitations are specified in international guidelines and standards. © 2015 Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB)..

AB  - The increasing demand for electricity has led humans to a growing exposure to artificial sources of electromagnetic emission, making it essential to determine the intensity of electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which is subject to the population of a given area. This Letter proposes an analysis of EMF exposure levels and spatial distribution over the region of the input and power circuits of a 230 kV/60 Hz air-insulated substation. For this, measurement protocols were determined based on current standards and from spatial interpolation methods, a contour map was developed, allowing a complete evaluation of the behaviour and levels of EMF throughout the region. The results obtained indicate that exposure levels in this region are below those recommended by regulatory agencies. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.

AB  - The development of solid-state electronics technology has led to the technically advanced electrical installation emergence, in particular Digital transformer substations (DTS) 10 (20)/0, 4 kV. However, due to the uniqueness and novelty of the development the adverse health effects of the digital transformer substation are currently absent. The article presents the theoretical studies results of negative effects of the industrial frequency of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on personnel health operating the high-voltage equipment DTS. EMF performance evaluation (intensity of electric and magnetic fields, body current capacitor) during DTS operation in various installed capacity 10/0, 4 kV and 20/0.4 kV has been done. The obtained results are compared to EMF level being created by highvoltage equipment of existing transformer substations and checked for compliance with current health standards. The characteristic curve of intensity of electric and magnetic fields, body current capacitor at nominal rating power, voltage and DTS electrical equipment are presented. It is shown that use of DTS in distribution networks scarcely has negative effect on the operating personnel health.

AB  - With the increase in electricity demand, new sources of power generation and transmission lines are needed. Thus, because of the need to meet the demand for electricity, transmission lines and substations are increasingly present in urban and local areas near the movement of people. Since electromagnetic fields are a result of the electrical installation, there are rules governing the field exposure levels due to the possibility of causing adverse health effects. The institution which sets the levels of exposure limits is ANEEL (Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica), with the Normative Resolution n° 398. The analysis of electromagnetic fields can be performed by measurements, analytical calculations, or through computer numerical solutions. This study aims to determine the electromagnetic fields from computer numerical solutions of an output line of a gas-insulated substation, determining the minimum distances for operation and pedestrian traffic. © 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

AB  - In the last years, the power demand of Perú keeps rising and the power system expands the scale extraordinary, in order to transport more energy, the overhead lines and substations in 500 kV has been built, especially in the last decade. Currently, the international standards for the minimum safety distances in electrical substations have been designed considering the insulation co-ordination, however if some designer considers the equipment installed in the same phase, there are just a recommendation in some papers, without considers the effect of electric and magnetic field and contamination between assets. This research has analyzed a failure mode caused by electric field in 500 kV substations, the problem was focus on current transformers. Three current transformers have failed, exploiting near the circuit breakers in the same phase, the analysis and the root cause of this fault has been developed in a special condition, the coast of Peru, and the novel contribution is a recommendation for the physical layout in substations, insulation coordination and standards of electric field for the design of substations for 500kV. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An ungrounded human, such as a substation worker, receives contact currents when touching a grounded object in electric fields. In this article, contact currents and internal electric fields induced in the human when exposed to non-uniform electric fields at 50Hz are numerically calculated. This is done using a realistic human model standing at a distance of 0.1-0.5m from the grounded conductive object. We found that the relationship between the external electric field strength and the contact current obtained by calculation is in good agreement with previous measurements. Calculated results show that the contact currents largely depend on the distance, and that the induced electric fields in the tissues are proportional to the contact current regardless of the non-uniformity of the external electric field. Therefore, it is concluded that the contact current, rather than the spatial average of the external electric field, is more suitable for evaluating electric field dosimetry of tissues. The maximum induced electric field appears in the spinal cord in the central nervous system tissues, with the induced electric field in the spinal cord approaching the basic restriction (100mV/m) of the new 2010 International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines for occupational exposure, if the contact current is 0.5mA.

AB  - A criterion is proposed for modeling the electric fields of extra-high-voltage lines and substations and the currents induced by them in the human body, the purpose being to study the biological influence of these fields and currents in the laboratory. A calculation method is given; a computer has been used to determine the fields and induced currents under a 750 kv line, at a 750 kv substation, as well as in a laboratory setup. The influence on the electric field and induced current exerted by the grounded structure and the laboratory wall adjacent to the test subject is estimated. The current is shown to depend substantially on the attitude and size of the person.

AB  - Among the current risks of (non-specific) occupational diseases or risks of persons, one may also include the risk of exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields (EMF). This problem has been in the hands of specialists for about six decades, but the questions regarding EMF effects and the admissible limits of the EMF's characteristic sizes have still not been answered. This paper aims to increase the accuracy of the EMF effects assessment on people exposed to stabilized regime areas of power plants. Firstly, the problem proposed to be solved is presented. Secondly, the fuzzy approach to the treatment we propose for assessing the severity caused by the human exposure to the stationary EMF is put forward together with all the particularities and modalities of fuzzy treatment in this case. The paper contains applications based on experimental data related to the assessment of the consequences of EMF exposure from one power substation. The final part of the paper presents the conclusions of the treatment and the developed applications. © ICI Bucharest 2012-2019.

AB  - Intensive usage of electromagnetic energy in the modern world has led to electromagnetic pollution of the environment. To ensure the electromagnetic compatibility, it is necessary to control the electromagnetic field levels under direct and indirect electromagnetic radiation influence, and visualize the space under study. Known methods and information systems used to control and monitor electromagnetic environment parameters have a narrow scope and do not allow quick performing multivariable electromagnetic monitoring, forming two-dimensional and three-dimensional danger images of electromagnetic radiation, integrating the necessary set of devices for multi-frequency control. The article proposes a method to create danger images of electromagnetic radiations in confined space with sources of electromagnetic fields based on criterion of allowed time of people stay. The article discusses the results of experimental research of the electromagnetic field danger produced by personal computer monitors, optical mice and multifunction devices such as printer-copier-scanner. The article presents the computer models of electromagnetic environment: in the electric field distribution images at 30 kHz frequency and electromagnetic radiation danger images on allowed stay time criterion. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past decades, electrical and magnetic field effects have received considerable attention among scientists and engineers. Much of this attention is due to the probability of an electrical and magnetic field to affect a human being and other biological beings. This paper is aiming to show if the electromagnetic field maximal values, in natural environment, in transmission lines and substation areas, in Jordan are meeting the requirements of many standards and correspond well to the data contained in the relevant world literature. Computations and field measurements for the strength of electric and magnetic fields are made to achieve this goal. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

AB  - This paper focuses on assessing the electric field exposure in the whole substation by the fault tree analysis. The component-level exposure situation along the path is studied by the reliability analysis, where the field distribution and the moving people are integrated. The system-level exposure situation is then analyzed by generating the exposure fault tree based on the component-level data. The exposure failure probability of the whole substation is ultimately evaluated by analyzing the fault tree's series-parallel system. The influences of the layers and the bounded parameters on the size of the fault tree are also studied in this paper. The results of the case study show that, with the help of the fault tree analysis, the complex exposure situation in a large substation can be clearly evaluated by a probability value. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - A method and program have been developed for calculating the electric fields at extrahigh- and superhigh-voltage substations as well as for calculating the electric current induced in a person at various work sites. Calculations have been made of the fields and induced currents acting on a worker near grounded current-carrying parts during maintenance of air-blast circuit breakers and on personnel during operations at ground level for substations handling various voltage classes. The calculated and measured results are in good agreement with one another. The requirements for effectiveness of means of protection are determined and recommendations given for their utilization.
